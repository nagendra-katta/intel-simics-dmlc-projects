<p>This document describes the features of the Intel® Simics® simulator, with in-depth explanations on their usage and implementation. A gentler introduction is provided in the <a href="../getting-started/index.html">Getting Started</a>.</p>
<p>The first chapters cover various aspects of Simics, from its command-line and scripting to the way simulation can be inspected and manipulated. The second part of the manual is dedicated to software debugging, both with Simics stand-alone or when using it as a back-end for other debuggers, such as Intel® System Debugger or GDB.</p>
<p>A simple virtual platform called Quick-Start Platform (QSP) is available to all users. This platform is used in many examples in the documentation and is intended to help users users familiarize themselves with many features of the Intel Simics simulator.</p>
