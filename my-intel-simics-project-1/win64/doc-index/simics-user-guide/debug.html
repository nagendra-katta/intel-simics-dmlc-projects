<div class="note">
<p>Simics Analyzer provides a full symbolic C/C++ debugger with a command line interface. You can read all about it in <a href="../analyzer-user-guide/index.html">Simics Analyzer User's Guide</a> . This can be used in parallel with the low-level features described in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<p>This chapter explains Simics's powerful, but low-level, breakpoint support.</p>
<h2 id="breakpoints"><a href="#breakpoints">3.2.1 Breakpoints</a></h2>
<p>Simics can set breakpoints on code and data. Unlike most debuggers, Simics breakpoints are not limited by what the hardware can support; for example, there is no restriction on the number of read/write breakpoints (also known as watchpoints).</p>
<p>In Simics you can set breakpoints on, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>memory accesses: any range and combination of read/write/execute</li>
<li>time (number of cycles or instructions executed)</li>
<li>instruction types, such as control register accesses</li>
<li>device accesses</li>
<li>output in the console</li>
<li>log output</li>
</ul>
<p>Simics is fully deterministic, and breakpoints in Simics are fully non-intrusive. This makes it possible to narrow down the location of difficult bugs by re-running the <em>exact</em> same run as many times as you need.</p>
<h3 id="the-breakpoint-manager"><a href="#the-breakpoint-manager">3.2.1.1 The Breakpoint Manager</a></h3>
<p>Simics has a <em>breakpoint manager</em> which stores information about all breakpoints, of all types. It has commands for listing breakpoints, enabling, deleting and other common operations. Breakpoint creation is specific to the different types, and is described in the following chapters. The breakpoint manager is the object <code>bp</code>.</p>
<p>In general, breakpoint creation commands return an ID, which can be used to later delete the breakpoint, or obtain information about it. The most important generic commands are</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bp.list</code>, which lists all breakpoints.</li>
<li><code>bp.delete</code>, which removes a particular breakpoint.</li>
<li><code>bp.show</code>, which shows more information about a particular breakpoint.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="memory-breakpoints"><a href="#memory-breakpoints">3.2.1.2 Memory Breakpoints</a></h3>
<p>A memory breakpoint stops the simulation whenever a memory location in a specified address interval is accessed. The address interval can be of arbitrary length and the type of memory access can be specified as any combination of <em>read</em>, <em>write</em>, and <em>execute</em>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to set memory breakpoints is to use the <code>bp.memory.break</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>output-radix 16</strong>
simics&gt; <strong>bp.memory.break p:0x10000</strong>
Breakpoint 1 set on address 0x10000 in 'board.mb.cpu0.mem[0][0]' with access mode 'x'
</code></pre>
<p>Prefix the address with <code>p:</code> or <code>v:</code> to get a physical or virtual address, respectively. As you can see in the following example, Simics defaults to interpreting a breakpoint address as virtual if you do not specify otherwise:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]-&gt;current_virtual_context = "board.cell_context"</strong>
simics&gt; <strong>bp.memory.break v:0x4711</strong>
[board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0] info] VMP not engaged. Reason: virtual breakpoint.
Breakpoint 2 set on address 0x4711 in 'board.cell_context' with access mode 'x'
simics&gt; <strong>bp.memory.break p:0x4711</strong>
Breakpoint 3 set on address 0x4711 in 'board.mb.cpu0.mem[0][0]' with access mode 'x'
simics&gt; <strong>bp.memory.break 0x4711</strong>
Breakpoint 4 set on address 0x4711 in 'board.cell_context' with access mode 'x'
Note: overlaps with breakpoint 2
</code></pre>
<p>This way of setting breakpoints will attach them to the memory space (physical address) or context (virtual address) connected to the <em>current processor</em>. If the current processor is not the processor you are interested in, it can be changed using the <code>pselect</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>pselect board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]</strong>
</code></pre>
<p>Without an argument, <code>pselect</code> prints the current processor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>pselect</strong>
"board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]"
</code></pre>
<p>Also useful is the <code>cpu</code> object alias, which returns the current processor and can be used to expand child objects, commands and aliases on the current processor.</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>cpu # type cpu&lt;tab&gt;</strong>
cpu-&gt;  cpu-pages-dump  cpu-switch-time  cpu.  cpu.vtime.
</code></pre>
<p>Physical memory breakpoints are handled by memory space objects. A memory space represents a physical address space; they sit between the processor and the actual hardware devices, for example RAM, that can be accessed with read and write instructions. Breakpoints are created with the memory space's <code>break</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]-&gt;physical_memory</strong>
"board.mb.cpu0.mem[0][0]"
simics&gt; <strong>board.mb.cpu0.mem[0][0].bp-break-memory address = 0x10000 length = 16 -w</strong>
Breakpoint 1 set on address 0x10000 in 'board.mb.cpu0.mem[0][0]', length 16 with access mode 'w'
</code></pre>
<p>Virtual memory breakpoints are handled by context objects. A context represents a virtual address space; you can learn more about them in chapter <a class="reference" href="#symbolic-debugging">3.2.2</a>. Essentially, they provide a level of indirection between processors and virtual memory breakpoints; a processor has a current context, which in turn has virtual breakpoints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]-&gt;current_context</strong>
"board.cell_context"
simics&gt; <strong>board.cell_context.bp-break-memory 0x1ff00</strong>
Breakpoint 2 set on address 0x1ff00 in 'board.cell_context' with access mode 'x'
</code></pre>
<p>Note that by default, all simulated processors in a cell share one context (<code>celln_context</code>). If you want a virtual breakpoint to apply only to a subset of the processors, create a new context just for them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>new-context foo</strong>
simics&gt; <strong>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].set-context foo</strong>
simics&gt; <strong>foo.bp-break-memory 0xffffffffbfc008b8</strong>
</code></pre>
<p>When creating execution breakpoints, it is possible to specify filter rules to only trigger when instructions match certain syntactical criteria. This feature is mainly useful with breakpoints covering large areas of memory. The available parameters to the break command are <em>prefix</em> (to match the start of an instruction), <em>substr</em> (to match a particular substring), and <em>pattern</em> (to match the bit pattern of the instruction).</p>
<p>For example, to stop when an instruction with the name <code>add</code> is executed in a memory range from 0x10000 to 0x12000, use the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>bp.memory.break 0x10000 0x2000 -x prefix = "add"</strong>
Breakpoint 1 set on address 0x10000 in 'board.cell_context', length 8192 with access mode 'x'
</code></pre>
<p>Simics will now break on the first add instruction encountered. For more information, see the
<a href="../rm-base/rm-cmd-categories.html#breakpoints">breakpoints section</a> in the <a href="../rm-base/index.html">Simics Reference Manual</a>
or use the <code>help bp.memory.break</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="temporal-breakpoints"><a href="#temporal-breakpoints">3.2.1.3 Temporal Breakpoints</a></h3>
<p>Unlike an ordinary debugger, Simics can handle temporal breakpoints, i.e., breakpoints in time. Since the concept of time is based on steps and cycles, to be precise a temporal breakpoint refers to a specific step or a cycle count as measured by a given processor, but one can also specify breakpoints in seconds of virtual time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>bp.cycle.break cpu0 100</strong>
simics&gt; <strong>bp.step.break cpu0 100</strong>
simics&gt; <strong>bp.time.break cpu0 1</strong>
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the breakpoints are specified relative to the current time. It is also possible to give temporal breakpoints in absolute time (where 0 refers to the time when the original configuration was set up in Simics).</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].bp-break-cycle -absolute 100</strong>
simics&gt; <strong>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].bp-break-step -absolute 100</strong>
simics&gt; <strong>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].bp-break-time -absolute 1</strong>
</code></pre>
<p>The commands <code>bp.cycle.break</code>, <code>bp.step.break</code> and <code>bp.time.break</code>, can be given without providing the CPU ad argument. This will set a breakpoint for the current processor.</p>
<h3 id="control-register-breakpoints"><a href="#control-register-breakpoints">3.2.1.4 Control Register Breakpoints</a></h3>
<p>A control register breakpoint triggers when the selected control register is accessed. The access type is determined by the break command parameters used.</p>
<p>To break on a control register <em>write</em>, use <code>bp.control_register.break</code>. For example, to break when the register <code>cr0</code> is written to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>bp.control_register.break name = cr0</strong>
</code></pre>
<p>To break on a control register <em>read</em>, use <code>bp.control_register.break -r</code>. For example, to break when the register <code>cr0</code> is read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>bp.control_register.break name = cr0 -r</strong>
</code></pre>
<p>A list of available control registers can be obtained by tab-completing the <em>name</em> argument. See the documentation for <a href="../rm-base/rm-cmd-bp-manager.cr.break.html">bp.control_register.break</a> in the
<a href="../rm-base/index.html">Simics Reference Manual</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="i-o-breakpoints"><a href="#i-o-breakpoints">3.2.1.5 I/O Breakpoints</a></h3>
<p>An I/O breakpoint is always connected to a specific device object. The breakpoint is triggered when that device is accessed. The breakpoint is set using the <code>break-io</code> command, which take the device name as a parameter. For example, to break on accesses to a device called <code>dma</code>, we would use the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>break-io device = board.mb.sb.dma</strong>
</code></pre>
<p>A list of devices can be obtained by tab-completing the <em>device</em> argument.</p>
<h3 id="text-output-breakpoints"><a href="#text-output-breakpoints">3.2.1.6 Text Output Breakpoints</a></h3>
<p>Many simulated machines have a <em>text console</em>—a terminal window hooked up to a serial port on the target machine, so that you can type commands to the target and get replies. In particular x86 systems also often have a <em>graphics console</em>—a window acting as a monitor to the machine, hooked up to a graphics device on the target machine, and usually also to keyboard and mouse devices.</p>
<p>A text console can halt the simulation on the occurrence of a given character sequence in the output; this is called a <em>text output breakpoint</em>. This is also possible on a graphics console when it is running in text mode graphics, assuming that the graphics device implements this.</p>
<p>To set a breakpoint, use the command <code>bp.console_string.break console string</code>, which returns a breakpoint id. Simics will stop when <em>string</em> appears in the output.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>To find out if a specific simulated machine uses these consoles, look for objects of class <code>textcon</code> or <code>graphcon</code> in the list provided by <code>list-objects</code> once the configuration is loaded.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="graphics-breakpoints"><a href="#graphics-breakpoints">3.2.1.7 Graphics Breakpoints</a></h3>
<p>If your target machine has a graphical display (as opposed to just a text console), you can set graphical breakpoints on it. A graphical breakpoint is a (small or large) bitmap image and a pair of coordinates; when the pixels at those coordinates on the simulated display exactly match the breakpoint image, the simulation will halt.</p>
<p>Graphics breakpoints can be created from the console GUI window, but the following commands can also be used to save and set breakpoints for a graphics console:</p>
<div class="dl">
<ul>
<li><span class="term" id="dt:gfx-console-save-break-xy-filename-left-top-right-bottom"><a href="#dt:gfx-console-save-break-xy-filename-left-top-right-bottom"><code>gfx-console.save-break-xy filename left top right bottom</code></a></span><br>
Let the user specify a rectangular area inside the graphics console using the top left and bottom right corners coordinates. The selected area will be saved as a binary graphical breakpoint file.</li>
<li><span class="term" id="dt:gfx-console-bp-break-gfx-filename"><a href="#dt:gfx-console-bp-break-gfx-filename"><code>gfx-console.bp-break-gfx filename</code></a></span><br>
Activate a previously saved breakpoint and return a breakpoint id. When a graphical breakpoint is reached, Simics halts execution and returns to the command prompt.</li>
<li><span class="term" id="dt:bp-delete-id"><a href="#dt:bp-delete-id"><code>bp.delete id</code></a></span><br>
Delete the breakpoint associated with <em>id</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="magic-instructions-and-magic-breakpoints"><a href="#magic-instructions-and-magic-breakpoints">3.2.1.8 Magic Instructions and Magic Breakpoints</a></h3>
<p>For each simulated processor architecture, a special nop (no-operation) instruction has been chosen to be a <strong>magic instruction</strong> for the simulator. When the simulator executes such an instruction, it triggers a <code>Core_Magic_Instruction</code> hap and calls all the callbacks functions registered on this hap.</p>
<p>Since magic instructions are just no-operation instructions on hardware, you can run code containing magic instructions on hardware as well as in the simulator, but you will not get any of the extra behavior Simics implements for the magic instruction.</p>
<p>If the architecture makes it possible, a magic instruction parameter is encoded as an immediate value in the magic instruction. When the hap is triggered, this value is passed as an argument to the hap handlers. This provides the user with a rudimentary way of passing information from the simulated system to the hap handler.</p>
<p>Magic instructions have to be compiled into the binary files that are executed on the target. The file <code>magic-instruction.h</code> in <code>[simics]/src/include/simics/</code> defines a <code>MAGIC(n)</code> macro that can be used to place magic instructions in your program, where <code>n</code> is the magic instruction parameter value to encode. Some parameter values are reserved for internal use; see figure <a class="reference" href="#magic_instruction_figure">29</a> and figure <a class="reference" href="#reserved_magic_numbers_figure">30</a>.</p>
<p>A complete list of magic instructions and the range of the parameter <code>n</code> is provided in figure <a class="reference" href="#magic_instruction_figure">29</a>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>The declaration of the macros are heavily dependent on the compiler used, so you may get an error message telling you that your compiler is not supported. In that case, you will have to write the inline assembly corresponding to the magic instruction you want to use. The GCC compiler should always be supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p>The magic instruction macro is directly usable only from C and C++; if your program is written in another language, you will have to call a C function that uses the macro, or an assembly function that includes the magic instruction. (If the language supports inline assembly, that can of course be used as well.) For example, in Java it would be necessary to use the JNI interface. Check your compiler and language documentation for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p>(x86 specific) The magic instruction parameter is passed through the <code>eax</code> register on x86. The <code>eax</code> register contents is preserved when the magic instruction is emulated by Simics. Thus the <code>eax</code> register value can be used just after the magic instruction to extract the magic parameter value from it. The values of the <code>ebx</code>, <code>ecx</code> and <code>edx</code> registers are undefined after the magic instruction. Earlier Simics versions had different definitions of magic instructions for x86. The old magic instruction can still be used on x86 if the processor is not running in VMP mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p>(PowerPC specific) There are two different encodings of the <code>rlwimi</code>-based magic instruction on PowerPC. On 64-bit models, the new encoding is always used; it is also the one generated by the <code>MAGIC()</code> and <code>MAGIC_BREAKPOINT()</code> macros in <code>magic-instruction.h</code> when compiling 64-bit PowerPC code. The old encoding is used on 32-bit models when the <code>old_rlwimi_magic</code> attribute is set. When compiling 32-bit PowerPC code, the macros will use the old encoding unless the preprocessor symbol <code>SIM_NEW_RLWIMI_MAGIC</code> has been defined.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the new encoding is used with 32-bit PowerPC models and code by setting the appropriate attribute and preprocessor symbol.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of how to use magic instructions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C">#include "magic-instruction.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        initialize();
        MAGIC(1);                     // tell the simulator to start
                                      // the cache simulation
        do_something_important();
        MAGIC(2);                     // tell the simulator to stop
                                      // the cache simulation
        clean_up();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code needs to be coupled with a callback registered on the magic instruction hap to handle what happens when the simulator encounters a magic instruction with the arguments 1 or 2 (in this example, to start and stop the cache simulation).</p>
<p>Simics implements a special handling of magic instructions called <strong>magic breakpoints</strong>. A magic breakpoint occurs if magic breakpoints are enabled and if the parameter <code>n</code> of a magic instruction matches a special condition. When a magic breakpoint is triggered, the simulation stops and returns to the prompt.</p>
<p>Magic breakpoints can be enabled with the command <code>bp.magic.break</code> . The condition on <code>n</code> for a magic instruction to be recognized as a magic breakpoint is the following:</p>
<pre><code>n == 0 || (n &amp; 0x3f0000) == 0x40000
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the value 0 is included for architectures where no immediate can be specified. The file <code>magic-instruction.h</code> defines a macro called MAGIC_BREAKPOINT that places a magic instruction with a correct parameter value in your program.</p>
<h2 id="symbolic-debugging"><a href="#symbolic-debugging">3.2.2 Symbolic Debugging</a></h2>
<p>A vital part of a debugger's task is to understand the system being debugged at a higher level than just machine instructions and memory contents. The user thinks in terms of processes, functions, and named variables, so the debugger presents a view of the software that matches these concepts. This view is even more important in Simics, where the user has access to the whole system and not only user processes. To handle this, Simics Analyzer provides a full symbolic debugger, which you can read about in <a href="../analyzer-user-guide/index.html">Simics Analyzer User's Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Simics provides only some primitive building blocks for basic debugging like <em>context objects</em>.</p>
<h3 id="contexts"><a href="#contexts">3.2.2.1 Contexts</a></h3>
<p>A <code>context</code> object represents a virtual address space. Each processor in the simulated system has a <em>current context</em>, which represents the virtual address space currently visible to code running on the processor. Virtual-address breakpoints are properties of contexts; different context objects have separate sets of virtual breakpoints, and by changing a processor's current context, you change its set of virtual breakpoints.</p>
<p>The correctness of the simulation does not depend on contexts in any way; the concept of multiple virtual address spaces is useful for <em>understanding</em> the simulated software, but not necessary for running it. What contexts to create and how to use them is entirely your business; Simics does not care.</p>
<p>By default, every processor in a simulation cell use the same default context. You may create new contexts and switch between them at any time. This allows you, for example, to maintain separate debugging symbols and breakpoints for different processes in your target machine. When a context is used in this manner (active when and only when a certain simulated process is active), the context is said to <em>follow</em> the process.</p>
<p><em>Simics Analyzer</em> will help you coordinate contexts for processes running on the target system.</p>
