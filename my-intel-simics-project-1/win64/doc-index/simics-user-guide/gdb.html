<p>This chapter describes how to use <code>gdb-remote</code>, a Simics module that lets you connect a GDB session running on your host machine to the simulated machine using GDB's remote debugging protocol, and use GDB to debug software running on the target machine.</p>
<p>If you load the <code>gdb-remote</code> module in Simics, you can use the remote debugging feature of GDB, the GNU debugger, to connect one or more GDB processes to Simics over TCP/IP. In order to do this, you need a GDB compiled to support the simulation's target architecture on whichever host you're running. The <code>gdb-remote</code> module has been tested with several different versions of GDB 6 and 7.</p>
<p>A prebuilt GDB is distributed in the Simics GDB (#1031) package. In a Simics project, the <code>bin/gdb</code> command (<code>bin\gdb.bat</code> on Windows) can be used to launch GDB.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>The <code>bin/gdb</code> or <code>bin\gdb.bat</code> commands will only work if Simics GDB (#1031) is installed and available as addon package in the Simics project.</p>
</div>
<p>To connect a GDB session to Simics, start your Simics session and run the <code>new-gdb-remote</code> command, optionally followed by a TCP/IP port number, which defaults to 9123 otherwise. This will automatically load the <code>gdb-remote</code> module. You can also specify which processor or context the remote debugger should be attached to with the <em>cpu</em> and <em>context</em> arguments.</p>
<p>When a configuration is loaded, Simics will start listening to incoming TCP/IP connections on the specified port. Run the simulated machine up to the point where you want to connect GDB. To inspect a user process or dynamically loaded parts of the kernel, the easiest solution might be to insert magic instructions at carefully chosen points. For static kernel debugging, a simple breakpoint on a suitable address will solve the problem.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>When debugging the start-up phase of an operating system, it might happen that gdb gets confused by the machine state and disconnects when you try to connect. In this case, execute a few instructions and try again.</p>
</div>
<p>Once Simics is in the desired state, start your GDB session, load any debugging information into it, and then connect it to Simics using the <code>target remote host:port</code> command, where <em>host</em> is the host Simics is running on, and <em>port</em> is the TCP/IP port number as described above. Here is a short sample session using <code>firststeps</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
(gdb) symbol-file targets/qsp-x86/images/yocto_linux/yocto-1.8-vmlinux
Reading symbols from targets/qsp-x86/images/yocto_linux/yocto-1.8-vmlinux...done.
(gdb) set endian little
The target is assumed to be little endian
(gdb) target remote localhost:9123
Remote debugging using localhost:9123
0x000000000000fff0 in unicast_sock ()
(gdb) 
</code></pre>
<p>Note that yocto-1.8-vmlinux is internal file and not distributed in the package, so the reader cannot run the example in simics.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>The GDB supplied with Simics has builtin support for several target architectures. The architecture will be set automatically when GDB connects, but for little-endian architectures (such as x86 and x86_64), the following GDB command has to be issued: <code>set endian little</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>From this point, you can use GDB to control the target machine by entering normal GDB commands such as <code>continue</code>, <code>step</code>, <code>stepi</code>, <code>info regs</code>, <code>breakpoint</code>, etc.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>GDB does not expect the target state to change while it is in control and has asked for the simulation to be stopped. If the simulation is started from another frontend (e.g., by the <code>continue</code> command from the Simics command line) then GDB will not be notified and will still use cached information about the program location and register values. To recover from such a situation, issue a GDB command that makes the simulation run.</p>
</div>
<p>To force Simics to close a connection, use the <code>gdb0.disconnect</code> command.</p>
<p>The <code>gdb-remote</code> module does not have any high-level information about the OS being run inside Simics. This means that in order to examine memory or disassemble code, the data or code you want to look at has to be in the active TLB.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>When using <code>gdb-remote</code> with targets supporting multiple address sizes (such as x86-64 and SPARC), you must have a GDB compiled for the larger address size. For SPARC, run GDB's configure script with the <code>--target=sparc64-sun-solaris2.8</code> option.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="remote-gdb-and-shared-libraries"><a href="#remote-gdb-and-shared-libraries">3.4.1 Remote GDB and Shared Libraries</a></h2>
<p>It takes some work to figure out how to load symbol tables at the correct offsets for relocatable object modules in GDB. This is done automatically for normal (non-remote) targets, but for the remote target, you have to do it yourself. You need to find out the actual address at which the shared module is mapped in the current context on the simulated machine, and then calculate the offset to use for GDB's <code>add-symbol-file</code> command.</p>
<p>Under Linux, the list of memory mappings can be found in the file <code>/proc/pid/maps</code> (plain text format). The <code>VMA</code> column of the <code>.text</code> line of the output from <code>objdump -h file</code> contains the start address of the text segment.</p>
<p>Using these two values, <em>map address</em> and <em>text address</em>, you should use <em>map address</em> + <em>text address</em> as the offset to <code>add-symbol-file</code> (it has to be done this way to compensate for how GDB handles symbol loading).</p>
<p>To show you how it works, we will work through a simple example. The example uses a simple program with a simple shared library. The program can be found in <code>[qsp-x86]/targets/qsp-x86/images/hello</code> and the shared library is the <code>libgreeter.so</code> file in the same directory. Here and in the rest of this section <em>[qsp-x86]</em> refers to the location where the QSP-x86 package is installed.</p>
<p>Start by booting the firststeps machine. Then mount the host file system and copy the program and shared library onto the machine. This should be done on the target:</p>
<pre><code>
~ # mount /host
~ # cp /host/[qsp-x86]/targets/qsp-x86/images/hello .
~ # cp /host/[qsp-x86]/targets/qsp-x86/images/libgreeter.so .
</code></pre>
<p>Then run the program in the background. The program will enter the infinite loop in the shared library.</p>
<p>Now we need the <em>map address</em> and the <em>text address</em> of the shared library. To get the map address, look in the process file system to see where it has mapped the shared library:</p>
<pre><code>
~ # ./hello &amp;

</code></pre>
<p>From this output you can see that the program is running with PID 13104 and that the map address is 0x7f686c990000. The exact PID may differ, adapt the commands accordingly.</p>
<p>To get the <em>text address</em> we use objdump. This should be run on a host computer with objdump installed:</p>
<pre><code>
&gt; objdump -h [qsp-x86]/targets/qsp-x86/images/libgreeter.so
libgreeter.so:     file format elf64-x86-64

Sections:
Idx Name          Size      VMA               LMA               File off  Algn
    :
 10 .text         00000134  00000000000005e0  00000000000005e0  000005e0  2**4
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, CODE
    :
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>.text</code> symbols starts at address <code>0x5e0</code> and this is what we call the <em>text address</em>, so if we connect GDB to Simics we have to add the symbols with an offset of <code>0x7f686c990000 + 0x5e0 = 0x7f686c9905e0</code>.</p>
<p>Now we can set up GDB, connect it to Simics, and debug the program:</p>
<pre><code>
(gdb) dir [qsp-x86]/targets/qsp-x86/
Source directories searched: [qsp-x86]/targets/qsp-x86:$cdir:$cwd
(gdb) add-symbol-file [qsp-x86]/targets/qsp-x86/images/libgreeter.so 0x7f686c9905e0

	.text_addr = 0x6c9905e0

(gdb)
</code></pre>
<p>This is just a toy program written to make it possible to debug it without any OS awareness. Normally you would use the OS awareness functionality described in <a href="../analyzer-user-guide/index.html">Simics Analyzer User's Guide</a> to debug user space programs.</p>
