<h2 id="index.html:abstract"><a href="#index.html:abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This document describes the CRAFF on-disk file format independently of its implementation. There is also a short discussion of possible improvements.</p>
<h2 id="index.html:overview"><a href="#index.html:overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>CRAFF (Compressed Random-Access File Format) is designed for storing large, sparse linear address spaces such as memory or disk dumps in a portable way.</p>
<p>To the user, a CRAFF file appears as a collection of addressable data blocks. The file can be sparse (blocks can be missing), and the presence of each block can be queried.</p>
<h2 id="index.html:conceptual-structure"><a href="#index.html:conceptual-structure">Conceptual structure</a></h2>
<p>The file format consists of a header, which contain parameters, and the data arranged as a radix tree:</p>
<pre><code>             root dir
root ----&gt; +---------+
           |---------|       lvl 1 dir
           |---------|----&gt; +---------+
           |---------|      |---------|       lvl 2 dir
           +---------+      |---------|----&gt; +---------+
                            |---------|      |---------|       data block
                            +---------+      |---------|----&gt; +---------+
                                             |---------|      |         |
                                             +---------+      |         |
                                                              |         |
                                                              +---------+
</code></pre>
<p>The header contains the size of each tree node (directory) and of the data blocks, and a pointer to the root directory block. The number of tree levels is implicit in the size of the directory and data blocks, and of the highest address used.</p>
<p>The is also a list of free blocks which have been created as other blocks have been erased. These free blocks are used when adding new data to the file. If the free block list is empty, new data is added last in the file.</p>
<h2 id="index.html:on-disk-structure"><a href="#index.html:on-disk-structure">On-disk structure</a></h2>
<p>All fields are unsigned integers unless stated otherwise, and all are stored in big-endian byte order.</p>
<p>The file header comes first in the file, and contains the following fields:</p>
<pre><code>Offset   Size    Field           Description
     0      4    magic           must be 0x89bf1e83 (in big-endian order)
     4      4    version         file format version. This document
                                 describes the version 1 format.
     8      4    block_bits	    log2 of the data block size in bytes.
                                 Default is 13 (8k blocks)
    12      4    sub_blocks	    number of sub-blocks each data block is
                                 subdivided into. Default is 16.
                                 Must be a power of 2.
    16      4    directory_bits  log2 of the number of entries per directory
                                 node. Default is 9 (512 entries)
    20      4    compression	    0 = none, 1 = bz2, 2 = zlib
    24      4    clean           1 if file was cleanly closed, 0 if not
    28      4    reserved
    32      8    free_list       file offset of the start of the free block
                                 list
    40      8    size            size of the address space. This is the size
                                 of the file encoded in the CRAFF file.
    48      8    root            file offset of the root directory block,
                                 or of the (only) data block if 
                                 size &lt;= (1&lt;&lt;block_bits).
</code></pre>
<p>The number of directory levels depends on the size, so that</p>
<pre><code>size &lt;= 2 ** (block_bits + directory_levels * directory_bits)
</code></pre>
<p>I.e.,</p>
<pre><code>directory_levels = max(ceil((ceil(log2(size)) - block_bits) / directory_bits), 0)
</code></pre>
<p>A logical address can be decomposed as follows (example shown with directory_levels == 3):</p>
<pre><code>bit 63.................................................................0
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |  0  |       d0      |       d1      |       d2      |    ofs     |
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+
            directory_bits  directory_bits  directory_bits   block_bits  
</code></pre>
<p>where d0 is the index into the root directory, d1 into the level 1 directory, and so on, and ofs the offset within the data block.</p>
<p>Each data or directory block is stored as one or more fragments, each preceded by a fragment header:</p>
<pre><code>Offset  Size     Field      Description
     0     8     size       size of this fragment in bytes, not including
                            this header
     8     8     next       file offset of the next fragment of this
                            logical block, or zero if last
(total size: 16 bytes)
</code></pre>
<p>To read a data or directory block, it is necessary to read each fragment and assemble them into a contiguous logical block, stripping the fragment headers.</p>
<p>A logical directory block is preceded by a directory header:</p>
<pre><code>Offset  Size    Field           Description
     0     4    num_entries     number of entries in this directory,
                                always equal to 1 &lt;&lt; directory_bits.
     4     4    reserved
(total size: 8 bytes)
</code></pre>
<p>The directory itself then consists of num_entries directory entries, each of which having the following format:</p>
<pre><code>Offset  Size    Field           Description
     0     4    present         1 if block is present, 0 if not
     4     4    reserved
     8     8    block_start     file offset to the block or directory
                                (its first fragment), if present == 1
(total size: 16 bytes)
</code></pre>
<p>Each logical data block is preceded by a sub-block bitmap, whose size is</p>
<pre><code>     bitmap_bytes = floor((sub_blocks + 7) / 8)
</code></pre>
<p>Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a sub-block. The bitmap is in little-endian byte and bit order: the Nth sub-block corresponds to bit <code>(N % 8)</code> of byte <code>(N / 8)</code> of the bitmap. Each sub-block counts as present if its bit is set in the bitmap, and absent otherwise.</p>
<p>Logical directory and data blocks are compressed according to the compression field in the file header. For data blocks, the compression includes the sub-block bitmap. The fragmentation is done after the compression, which is done one logical block at a time.</p>
<p>The free block list is a linked list of free chunks in the file. Each chunk begins the following header:</p>
<pre><code>Offset  Size    Field           Description
     0     8    size            size of chunk in bytes, not including
                                this header
     8     8    next            file offset to next free chunk,
                                or zero if last
(total size: 16 bytes)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the free list has the same format as the fragment list for each logical block. This way, the fragments of a freed logical block can quickly be appended to the free list.</p>
<h2 id="index.html:problems-and-improvements"><a href="#index.html:problems-and-improvements">Problems and improvements</a></h2>
<p>The num_entries field in the directory header is superfluous since it must be equal to <code>(1&lt;&lt;directory_bits)</code>. This means that the directory header can be eliminated.</p>
<p>The "present" field of each directory entry can be eliminated by setting the block_start field to zero if the block is absent. This would make the directory blocks half as big as before, or double their capacity, which would reduce the average number of directory levels and therefore reduce the number of disk accesses.</p>
<p>It would be possible to change this while keeping code for compatibility with the version 1 format.</p>
<p>In uncompressed files, the fragment list is not used since blocks always keep their size regardless of content. In this case the fragment headers could be eliminated, storing logical blocks directly. This would give a minor space saving and possibly better alignment of blocks to actual disk blocks, possibly increasing performance.</p>
<p>If sub_blocks is 1, then the sub-block bitmap is not really required (the single sub-block could always be considered "present"). This would be the common case when a craff file represents memory.</p>
