<p>Some common limitations for most trackers are that they rely on monitoring OS data structures, registers and processor state. If the behavior of any of these are changed, for example between kernel versions or due to different configuration options when compiling the kernel, the tracker may require an update in order to work with that specific kernel.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Simics debugger has special requirements on trackers in order to be compatible so all trackers may not work with it. The Linux tracker and UEFI Firmware tracker, for example, do work.</li>
<li>OS Awareness will impact the simulation performance. Commands such as <code>&lt;bp-manager.os-awareness&gt;.break</code> or <code>&lt;osa_component&gt;.bp-break</code> will also impact the performance negatively. Registering notification callbacks, especially from Python, can also have an impact on performance.</li>
<li>The gdb-remote extension has not been tested together with OS Awareness and may not work.</li>
<li>See respective tracker's documentation for a list of limitations for that tracker.</li>
</ul>
