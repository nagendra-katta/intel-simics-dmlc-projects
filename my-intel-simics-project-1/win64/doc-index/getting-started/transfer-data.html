<p>There are several situations when it is necessary and/or useful to let the simulated target machine interact with the host system, or even other systems accessible to the host via networking. Probably the most common situation is the need to transfer files between the target and the host.</p>
<p>To summarize the available methods of transferring files between the target system and host machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With special software running <em>on the target</em> which communicates with the simulator, it is possible to transfer data between the target and the host while the target is running. Examples of this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Intel Simics agent, which can transfer files but also provides other kinds of interaction with the target system. A tutorial for this the agent available <a href="transfer-data-simics-agent.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>The Intel SimicsFS, which is a file system based on <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/fuse.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">FUSE</a>. Read more about <em>Intel SimicsFS</em> in <a href="../simics-user-guide/managedisks.html#using-simicsfs-with-fuse"><em>Simics User's Guide</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
Note that using these method may require the extra steps of building and transferring the special software to the target system.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>With disk images, for example and USB disk, files can be transferred.
A tutorial on this is available <a href="transfer-data-usb.html">here</a>.
See also the section about how to use <a href="virtual-disks.html">virtual disks</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the target system has <em>networking support</em>, either a <a href="transfer-data-ftp.html">simulated network</a> can be used, or the target system can be connected to a <em>real network</em>, and use, for example <a href="transfer-data-napt-http.html">HTTP</a> or <a href="transfer-data-ssh.html">SSH/SCP</a> for the transfer.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p>In the tutorials, it is recommended to <em>start with the <a href="transfer-data-preparation.html">preparation</a></em> section, which will save time by using a checkpoint where Linux has booted.</p>
