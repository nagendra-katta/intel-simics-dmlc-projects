<p>This document provides an introduction to the Intel Simics product and some of its features. Intel Simics is a full-system simulator mainly targeting software development and analysis. To do so, it provides hardware and software inspection, dynamic system configuration, hardware modelling tools, scripting, and a rich set of other features. Unlike many other virtual machine products, the Intel Simics simulator does not focus on being a hardware replacement, although it can be used in that way.</p>
<p>The introduction in this document is in the form of a few short step-by-step tutorials.</p>
<h2 id="conventions"><a href="#conventions">1.1 Conventions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scripts, screen dumps and code fragments are presented in a <code>monospace</code> font.
In screen dumps, user input is always presented in bold font, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">Welcome to the Simics prompt
simics&gt; <strong>this is something that you should type</strong>
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character "/" is used to separate directories and files, for Linux. If you
are using Windows, you should read the character as "\" instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intel-simics-terminology"><a href="#intel-simics-terminology">1.2 Intel Simics Terminology</a></h2>
<p>This section presents the terminology used throughout Intel Simics documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel Simics Packages</strong> are the installable packages.
The packages are can be identified by number or by name.
Noteworthy packages:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Intel Simics Base package (#1000)</strong>, referred to as the <strong>base package</strong>,
containing the simulator.</li>
<li>Other packages are referred to as <strong>add-on packages</strong>, and these
typically contains extra tools or simulated hardware targets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An <strong>Intel Simics installation</strong> is a set of installed Intel Simics <em>packages</em>.</li>
<li>An <strong>Intel Simics project</strong>, referred to as <strong>the project</strong> is the workspace
where the simulator is started. The project is configured with a set associated
packages, at least the <em>base package</em> and possibly
some <em>add-on</em> packages. Besides starting the simulator, the user can create custom
start scripts and also read documentation for all packages available to the
project.</li>
<li>The <strong>Simics Command Line Interface</strong>, referred to as the <strong>CLI</strong> is the main
interface to simulator for most users and is started by default. It is also
possible to launch the simulator in non-interactive, <em>batch</em> mode, which can be
useful when running tests. In the CLI, both <em>Python</em> and the <em>Simics script
language</em> are available, and can be used interchangeably.</li>
<li>The <strong>host</strong>, or the <strong>host machine</strong> is the computer where the Intel Simics
simulator is running.</li>
<li>The <strong>target machine</strong> or <strong>target system</strong> is the hardware being simulated.</li>
</ul>
<p>To simulate a <em>target machine</em>, a <em>configuration</em> must be created.
A <em>configuration</em> consists of <em>objects</em>, object hierarchy,
properties, and connections between <em>objects</em>.</p>
<p>The default way of creating a configuration is to <em>load a target</em>.
For legacy reasons, it is also possible to create configurations by running
CLI or Python scripts.</p>
<p>When creating a configuration for a specific target machine, it is often possible
to <em>customize</em> properties of the target machine.
For <em>targets</em>, the configurable parameters are called <em>target parameters</em>.
(see <a href="../simics-user-guide/script-support-in-simics.html#targets-and-parameters"><em>Simics User's Guide</em></a>).</p>
<p>A simulation session can contain multiple target machines, for example when
simulating a network.</p>
<p>For interaction with the target system, the simulator can show <em>graphics
consoles</em> and <em>serial consoles</em>.</p>
