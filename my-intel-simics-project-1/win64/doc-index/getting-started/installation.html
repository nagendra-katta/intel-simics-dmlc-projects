<p>These are installation steps that should have been followed
before running any of the tutorials.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Intel Simics <em>base package</em> (package number 1000) has been installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>QSP-x86</em> package (package number 2096) has been installed.
This package contains a simple x86 system with the <code>qsp-x86/firststeps</code> target which will be used in many examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>project</em> directory has been created (referred to as [project] below) which
has the <em>QSP-x86</em> package as an add-on package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://grml.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">Grml</a> live <em>full</em> ISO image from the stable <em>2024.02</em> release
named <code>grml64-full_2024.02.iso</code> has been downloaded
and placed in the <em>project</em> directory.</p>
<p>The direct download link for this image is:<br>
<a href="https://download.grml.org/grml64-full_2024.02.iso" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">https://download.grml.org/grml64-full_2024.02.iso</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For information on how to install the simulator and create a project, see the
<a href="../installation-guide/index.html">Installation Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Some tutorials require that the <em>QSP Clear Linux (#4094)</em> package is
installed and available as an add-on package in the project.
If you don't have this package, reading the tutorials and referenced
manuals will still provide an overview on the subject.</p>
