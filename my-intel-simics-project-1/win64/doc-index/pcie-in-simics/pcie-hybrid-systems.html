<p>Hybrid setups where part of the platform runs outside Simics is a common use case.
One challenge with hybrid platforms is to properly integrate it into Simics.
There needs to be a layer working in both directions to translate transactions,
events, API calls from one system to the other.
This chapter focuses on integrating Emulators, external
Simulators or Hardware into a Simics PCIe Hierarchy. The word Shim is defined in
this chapter as the integration layer between Simics PCIe and an external process.</p>
<h2 id="shim-concept"><a href="#shim-concept">Shim Concept</a></h2>
<p>The Shim acts upstream as a Simics PCIe device and for downstream
it will follow the IPC protocol shared with the external PCIe system.
The Shim captures all upstream Simics PCIe traffic and events and converts
them to the IPC protocol. The Shim supports asynchronous responses and concurrent
requests made by the external device. For each transaction coming from upstream
the Shim blocks Simics from progressing in time until the external device has responded
to the transaction. This is done to ensure that Simics virtual simulation time
is not affected by the response time of the external process.</p>
<p>For PCIe writes and PCIe messages the Shim will wait for the external device
to have handled the event before completing the transaction to the initiator
which could be a CPU or device.</p>
<p>For PCIe reads the Shim will wait until the external device has responded
with the read payload.</p>
<p>While the Shim waits for a response to a PCIe transaction it sent to the
external PCIe system, it can receive upstream facing PCIe transactions from
the external PCIe system. The Shim will forward those requests upstream
and send responses back to the external PCIe system.
All of this is done in a thread safe manner.</p>

<p>The Shim supports both regular PCIe EPs and RCiEPs.</p>
<p>The <code>Shim Frontend</code> is a DML device appearing as a regular Simics PCIe device.
It has two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward all downstream PCIe traffic to the <code>Shim C++</code> device on a <strong>single</strong>
interface.</li>
<li>Map in the programmed BAR resources of the external device into the Root Complex
in Simics. It does this by snooping on write accesses to the BAR registers of the
Endpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Shim C++</code> device is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converting the Simics PCIe data into the IPC protocol format and vice versa.</li>
<li>Blocking Simics until the external device has responded.</li>
<li>Forwarding PCIe traffic from the external device into the Simics PCIe domain
and responding back to the external device.</li>
<li>Concurrency between upstream and downstream traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>external-connection</code> module is a separate generic module in Simics responsible for IPC.
It currently has classes to do communication over Unix sockets, TCP or Windows named pipes. The <code>Shim</code>
will interact with it over the <code>external_connection_ctl</code> and <code>external_connection_events</code> interfaces.
The Shim is not aware whether the communication is over TCP, Unix Socket or named pipes.
All of that is hidden inside the <code>external-connection</code> module.
The <code>external-connection</code> classes are <code>unix-socket-server</code>, <code>tcp-server</code> and <code>named-pipe-server</code>.</p>
<h2 id="integrating-a-non-simics-pcie-switch-to-simics"><a href="#integrating-a-non-simics-pcie-switch-to-simics">Integrating a non-Simics PCIe Switch to Simics</a></h2>

<p>The setup to integrate an external PCIe hierarchy to Simics is very similar
to an Endpoint. The <code>Shim Frontend</code>, written in DML, is the only difference
from the Endpoint setup on the Simics side.</p>
<p>The <code>Shim Frontend</code> when connecting an external PCIe Switch represents a shell
of the USP of the switch. It snoops on write accesses to the BAR registers of the USP
similar to the <code>Shim Frontend</code> of the Endpoint.
But it also snoops on the <em>(Prefetchable) Memory Base</em>, <em>Secondary Bus Number</em> and
<em>Subordinate Bus Number</em> registers of the USP of the Switch in order to map
in the downstream resources of the USP device into Simics.</p>
<h2 id="shim-source-code"><a href="#shim-source-code">Shim Source Code</a></h2>
<p>The source code for the Shim is distributed in module <code>sample-pcie-shim</code>.
It can be used as a starting point when integrating external PCIe subsystems.</p>
<h3 id="shim-frontend-source-code"><a href="#shim-frontend-source-code">Shim Frontend Source Code</a></h3>
<p>There are two variants of the Shim Frontend. One for PCIe ports and one
for endpoints. The file <code>pcie-shim-frontend-common.dml</code> contains the base
templates for the port and endpoints and can be reused as is.
Files <code>pcie-endpoint-shim-frontend.dml</code> and <code>pcie-port-shim-frontend.dml</code>
defines the sample device classes for the PCIe port and endpoint frontends.
They contain <em>BAR</em> registers that mirror the real hardware. These two files
would need to be redefined for each project in order to match the
<em>BARs</em> for the external PCIe device.
The frontend does <strong>not</strong> need to mirror the capability set
of the external device since it delegates all transactions to it.</p>
<h3 id="pcie-shim-c-source-code"><a href="#pcie-shim-c-source-code">PCIe Shim C++ Source Code</a></h3>
<p>The Shim base class, <strong>ShimPcie</strong>, is defined in the files <code>pcie-shim.h</code> and <code>pcie-shim.cc</code>.
The class handles the interface calls to and from the Shim PCIe DML Frontend.
The exchanges with the external process must be implemented by the user
inheriting the <strong>ShimPcie</strong> class. A set of virtual methods are declared,
these are the entry points for the external exchange implementation.
The <strong>ShimPcie</strong> class can be reused as is.</p>
<p>The Simics side of the Shim consists of two parts:
First, the implementation of the Simics interfaces to receive upstream transactions
and Hot Reset. Method <code>ShimPcie::issue</code> receives all transactions and translates
the PCIe atoms into arguments forwarded to the different function handlers
(Config, Memory, Message, IO) named <code>ShimPcie::forward...</code>.
The <code>ShimPcie::forward_...</code> functions have to be implemented by the user integrating
the external simulator/emulator/hardware.
Function <code>ShimPcie::hot_reset</code> must be implemented by the user.
Secondly, an implementation of functions <code>ShimPcie::upstream_message</code>,
<code>ShimPcie::upstream_mem_read</code> and <code>ShimPcie::upstream_mem_write</code> are part of
the <code>ShimPcie</code>. These functions create a corresponding Simics PCIe transaction
and forward it upstream.</p>
<h4 id="sample-pcie-traffic-over-ipc"><a href="#sample-pcie-traffic-over-ipc">Sample PCIe Traffic over IPC</a></h4>
<p>The <code>sample-pcie-shim</code> module also contains sample code to showcase an
IPC implementation between Simics and an external PCIe subsystem. It gives
the user a good starting point for integrating the external PCIe subsystem with Simics.</p>
<p>File <code>pcie-external-connection.cc</code> defines the class <code>PcieExternalConnection</code>.
It inherits the base class <code>ShimPcie</code> and implements the IPC functionality.
The <code>PcieExternalConnection</code> class implements interface <code>external_connection_event</code>
in order to interact with the Simics <code>external-connection</code> module classes.
Supported IPC mechanisms in the <code>external-connection</code> module are
<em>Unix Sockets</em>, <em>TCP</em> or Windows <em>Named Pipes</em>.</p>
<p>File <code>ExternalPcieFormat.h</code> defines the packet format used for the
sample PCIe IPC traffic.</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PcieExternalConnection::write_async</code> sends the packet to the
external process.</li>
<li><code>PcieExternalConnection::wait_for_response</code> After a request packet is sent to the external
process Simics will wait in this method for a response. This method blocks Simics from
progressing in virtual simulation time. Concurrent packet requests coming from the
external process is handled by this method as well. It called in <em>Simics cell context</em>.</li>
<li><code>PcieExternalConnection::on_input</code> is called whenever there is packet data to be read.
This method runs in <em>Simics Threaded context</em>. Only a small subset of the Simics API functions
are allowed to be executed in this context. The method reads the available data and
pushes it into a ring buffer. It then either posts a Simics event to schedule processing
of the packet in Simics <em>Cell Context</em> or it wakes up the blocking thread that executes
the <code>PcieExternalConnection::wait_for_response</code> method.</li>
<li><code>PcieExternalConnection::read_input</code> reads <em>N</em> number of bytes of packet data and pushes
it into the ring buffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The C++ code is based on the <em>Simics C++ Device API v2</em> library.
Please check out the <a href="../cc-device-api/index.html"><em>C++ Device API v2</em></a> manual.</p>
<div class="note">
The sample Shim supports a limited set of PCIe atoms.
If the external PCIe subsystem requires ATS, PRS, IDE or PCIe segment numbering
one will have to extend the sample PCIe shim.

<h3 id="connecting-to-a-pcie-slot"><a href="#connecting-to-a-pcie-slot">Connecting to a PCIe Slot</a></h3>
<p>The <code>sample-pcie-shim</code> module provides a sample component, <code>sample_pcie_shim_comp.py</code>
that adds the Shim Frontend and the Sample Shim in a component and registers
<code>PciBusUpConnector</code> to easily create and connect the objects into
the Simics PCIe hierarchy. It registers two components: <code>sample-pcie-switch-shim-comp</code>
to connect external switches and <code>sample-pcie-endpoint-shim-comp</code> to connect external
endpoints.</p>
<p>It can be connected to the Simics PCIe hierarchy with the below commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>load-module sample-pcie-shim</strong>
simics&gt; <strong>new-sample-pcie-switch-shim-comp name = shim socket_type = tcp</strong>
simics&gt; <strong>shim.connect-to dst = root_port</strong>
Connecting shim.upstream_target to root_port.slot[0]
