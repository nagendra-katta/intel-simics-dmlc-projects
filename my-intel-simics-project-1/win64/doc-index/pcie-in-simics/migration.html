<p>This section of the documentation focuses on providing a guide for how to
migrate PCIe devices written with the legacy PCI library (devices that import
<code>pci/common.dml</code> for endpoint implementations or <code>pci/pcie-to-pcie.dml</code> for port
implementations). Additionally a short overview of some high-level differences
between the two libraries is provided. For a proper understanding of this
library, it is important to read the other sections of the <a href="index.html">PCIE Modelling
Library Documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-difference"><a href="#high-level-difference">High-level Difference</a></h2>
<p>The new PCIe library utilizes modern Simics features, such as <code>transaction_t</code>,
<code>atom_t</code>, <code>map_target_t</code> and <code>transaction_translator</code> in its implementation. The
transaction_t data type has a number of advantages compared to the
generic_memory_operation data type that the prior library was based on. It
provides better traceability, easier debugging, asynchronous operations and the
ability to easily add inspectable extensions. Improved performance for an device
doing DMA is also a benefit. In addition, <code>atom_t</code> maps well to different TLP
headers or fields.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new library is implemented
from the ground up using modern DML 1.4. While there is a 1.4 version of the old
library, it was initially implemented using 1.2 and the 1.4 is a compatibility
port. With modern DML, more PCIe specific functionality can be handled by the
library without the user of the library having to do it. An example of this is
having to reference all the functions banks for multi-function endpoint in a
param. Similarly with BAR registers of a function having to be referenced in
param. It also simplifies for the user to override aspects of the library
without changes necessarily needed in the library itself or having to fork the
library.</p>
<p>The library also provides support for partial migration of parts of a PCIe
topology implemented using the legacy PCI library.
<code>pcie-downstream-port-legacy</code>, which can be utilized in switch and root ports
implemented with the new PCIe library, allows for connecting devices that are
implemented using the legacy PCI library. Similarly, the
<code>legacy-upstream-pcie-adapter</code> allows for connecting devices implemented with
the new PCIe library, to a port implemented using the legacy PCI library.</p>
<h3 id="pci-bus-and-pcie-downstream-port"><a href="#pci-bus-and-pcie-downstream-port"><code>pci-bus</code> and <code>pcie-downstream-port</code></a></h3>
<p>The legacy PCI library, which implements a PCI(e) hierarchy using a <code>pci-bus</code> or
<code>pcie-bus</code>. These are devices that implement the <code>pci_bus</code> Simics interface and
represent a PCI(e) bus. An endpoint or root/switch port would then reside on
such a bus by being set in the bus' <code>pci_devices</code> attribute. Say you have a
switch, it has an internal bus stemming from the upstream port where only the
upstream downstream ports may reside. Then each downstream port creates a new
bus underneath it where endpoints or upstream ports would reside. Each bus in
this case would be a <code>pci-bus</code> or <code>pcie-bus</code> object when using the legacy PCI
library. You could say that the legacy PCI(e) library was bus oriented i.e. the
main abstraction was the <code>pci-bus</code> or <code>pcie-bus</code> and that stems from that it was
originally developed for PCI which is bus oriented and PCIe support was added on
top of it. The new library drops the bus centric legacy and is modelled around
ports. This maps more easily to the current PCIe specification which to a large
extent is focused on point to point links with ports at both ends (with the
obvious exception of PCIE switches). Hence, with the new library the main
abstractions are instead <code>pcie-downstream-port</code> or
<code>pcie-downstream-port-legacy</code>. Each root/switch port implemented with the new
library (a device or subdevice that instantiates one of the template
<code>pcie_&lt;root/upstream/downstream&gt;_port</code>) will also create a subdevice object of
the class <code>pcie-downstream-port</code> (can be overridden to the legacy compatible
variant or a custom variant). Devices would then reside on the <code>devices</code>
attribute of the <code>pcie-downstream-port</code> object or (<code>pci_devices</code> attribute in
the case of connecting a legacy device to <code>pcie-downstream-port-legacy</code>).</p>
<p><code>pcie-downstream-port</code>:s, unlike <code>pci-bus</code>, does not require creating
memory-space objects for each of <code>cfg</code>, <code>mem</code> and <code>io</code> space, as it is handles
this internally. This simplifies component code from</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">bus = self.add_pre_obj('pci_bus', ‘pcie-bus’)
bus.memory_space = self.add_pre_obj('pci_mem', 'memory-space’)
bus.conf_space = self.add_pre_obj('pci_conf', 'memory-space')
bus.io_space = self.add_pre_obj('pci_io', 'memory-space')
bus.pci_devices = […]
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dp = self.add_pre_obj(‘pcie_dp', ‘pcie-downstream-port’)
dp.devices = […]
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, when using <code>pci-bus</code>, even after placing a PCIe port device in the
<code>pci_devices</code> attribute, one also has to set the <code>secondary_bus</code> of the port
device to the bus as well. This is not needed with <code>pcie-downstream-port</code> as the
port implemented with the new library only has to be put in the <code>devices</code> or
<code>pci_device</code> attribute of the <code>pcie-downstream-port(-legacy)</code>.</p>

documentation to get a more elaborate high-level overview of the new PCIe
library.</p>
<h3 id="the-old-library-is-considered-legacy"><a href="#the-old-library-is-considered-legacy">The Old Library is Considered Legacy</a></h3>
<p>The new PCIe library supports many more features from more recent versions of
the PCIe specification. No new features are being implemented for the old
library as it is considered legacy.</p>
<h2 id="steps-for-migrating-devices"><a href="#steps-for-migrating-devices">Steps for Migrating Devices</a></h2>
<p>This section describes common steps for migrating different PCIe devices
implemented with the legacy PCI library. Keep in mind that the device that is
being migrated might be doing some custom utilization of the legacy library, and
migrating such things is most likely not covered by this section. However,
reading these steps, along with the rest of the documentation for this library,
might provide clues on how to go about migrating that custom logic.</p>
<h3 id="single-function-endpoints"><a href="#single-function-endpoints">Single Function Endpoints</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>If the device to be migrated is not written in DML 1.4 (but rather 1.2),
first port it to 1.4. Instruction for this can be found in <a href="../dml-1.4-reference-manual/port-dml.html">Porting DML 1.2
to DML 1.4</a>.</li>
<li>Import the new library instead of the old library: <code>import pci/common.dml</code> -&gt;
<code>import pcie/common.dml</code></li>
<li>If the device instantiates the <code>pcie_device</code>, instead instantiate
<code>pcie_endpoint</code>. Also remove the <code>pci_hotplug</code> param if defined.</li>
<li>Set the <code>pcie_version</code> param to a suitable value.</li>
<li>Start by migrating the pci config bank to be implemented using the new
library.
<ol>
<li>Rename the <code>pci_config</code> bank to `pcie_config``.</li>
<li>Remove the <code>base_address_register</code> param in the <code>pcie_config</code> bank</li>
<li>Migrate the capabilities in the PCI and PCIe configuration space to
utilize the new capability templates (link to doc where these are
documented).</li>
<li>Ensure that the capabilities_ptr points to the first capability in the
non-extended PCI configuration space.</li>
<li>The existing bar registers should already be instantiating
<code>memory_base_address_64</code> or <code>memory_base_address_32</code>. Remove the
<code>map_func</code> params from these registers and add a new param <code>map_obj</code>.
This param should be an object that should be mapped by this bar
register. The object will start at offset 0 in the mapped area by the BAR
register. This object could for instance be a bank (example where the
device has a bank defined in dml with the name "my_bank"): <code>param map_obj = my_bank.obj</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Remove the <code>function</code> <code>param</code> and the <code>function_mapped_bank</code> template
instantiations in banks that were mapped by BAR registers.</li>
<li>If the device uses legacy PCI interrupts, change the handling of the
interrupt_pin values from calling
<code>pci_raise_interrupt(...)</code>/<code>pci_lower_interrupt(...)</code> to either
<code>pcie_config.raise_legacy_interrupt()</code>/<code>pcie_config.lower_legacy_interrupt()</code>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Note that if the device instead uses
<code>pci_raise_interrupt_pin()</code>/<code>pci_lower_interrupt_pin()</code> and uses INTx
emulation in a way that is not allowed by the PCIe spec (for example
having a single function being able to assert multiple virtual pins). One
has to utilize the <code>pcie_config.set_legacy_interrupt()</code> method along with
checking and setting the applicable INTx registers in the config bank:</p>
<pre><code class="language-dml">dml 1.4;
device legacy_irq_dev;
import "pcie/common.dml";
is pcie_endpoint;

template custom_legacy_irq {
    method assert_intx(pci_interrupt_pin_t pin) {
        this.status.ins.set(1);
        if (this.command.id.val == 0)
            this.set_legacy_interrupt(pin, 1);
    }

    attribute raise_legacy_irq is (pseudo_attr, uint64_attr) {
        method set(attr_value_t val) throws {
            local pci_interrupt_pin_t pin = SIM_attr_integer(val);
            if ((pin &gt;= PCI_INTERRUPT_INTA) &amp;&amp; (pin &lt;= PCI_INTERRUPT_INTD))
                pcie_config.assert_intx(pin);
        }
    }
}

bank pcie_config is custom_legacy_irq {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Where pin would be the +1 value of that would have been passed to
<code>pci_raise_interrupt_pin()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calls to <code>pci_data_from_memory(...)</code>/<code>pci_data_to_memory(...)</code> should be
replaced with calls to
<code>pcie_config.memory.read_bytes()</code>/<code>pcie_config.memory.write_bytes()</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the device uses MSI and/or MSI-X.
<ol>
<li>For MSI, assuming the MSI capability instantiation in the config bank has
been migrated to the capability templates from the new library, MSI
interrupts can be handled by calling
<code>pcie_config.msi.raise()</code>/<code>pcie_config.msi.lower()</code>.</li>
<li>For MSI-X, when the MSI-X capability instantiation in the config bank has
been migrated to the capability templates from the new library, the
<code>msix_data_bank</code> param in the MSI-X capability must be set. This should be a
bank that has instantiated the <code>msix_table</code> template. This bank in turn
should set a param <code>msix_bank</code> to a bank that is associated with this MSIX
table (in a single function endpoint that would be pcie_config). Then
instead of calling
<code>pci_config.pci_raise_msix_interrupt()</code>/<code>pci_config.pci_lower_msix_interrupt()</code>,
one would call <code>pcie_config.msix.raise()</code>/<code>pcie_config.msix.lower()</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="multi-function-endpoints"><a href="#multi-function-endpoints">Multi-function Endpoints</a></h3>
<p>Similar process to the single function endpoint migration process. Steps that
differ will be mentioned below.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the device instantiates the <code>pci_mf_device</code>, instead import
<code>pcie_multifunction_endpoint</code>. Also remove the <code>param pcie_device=true</code> from
the device (and <code>pci_hotplug</code> if defined).</li>
<li>Remove the <code>mf_banks</code> param.</li>
<li>In each physical function bank, replace the <code>mf_fun</code> param with <code>function</code>
(with the same value).</li>
<li>In each physical function bank, replace the instantiation of the
<code>pci_config_type_0_mf</code> instantiation with <code>type_0_bank</code> template.</li>
<li>Remove any instantiations of <code>providing_legacy_interrupts</code> and
<code>providing_dma_methods</code>. Legacy interrupts and DMA can be achieved similarly
to the single endpoints explained previously (call the interrupt or memory
methods defined in the config bank).</li>
<li>In each physical function bank, if it has the ARI capability
<ol>
<li>Remove the use of the ARI capability template from the legacy PCIe
library (<code>defining_pcie_ari_capability_v3</code>) and instead use
<code>defining_ari_capability</code>.</li>
<li>The nfn field should now instead be set within the <code>capability</code> register
in the <code>ari</code> group of the function bank.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="functions-implementing-sr-iov"><a href="#functions-implementing-sr-iov">Functions Implementing SR-IOV</a></h3>
<p>Similar process to the single/multi-function endpoint migration. Additional
steps described below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Locate all physical functions (the <code>pci_config</code> or banks that instantiate
<code>pci_config_type_0_mf</code>) that are associated with virtual functions.</li>
<li>Assuming the instantiation of the SR-IOV capability template from the old
library has been replaced with the template from the new one.
<ol>
<li>Remove the <code>sriov_vf_bars</code> param and the sriov_total_vfs register.</li>
<li>Move the SR-IOV BAR registers to group <code>sriov</code> (created by the
instantiation of <code>defining_sriov_capability</code>). Have these registers
still instantiating the <code>vf_bar_64</code> or the <code>vf_bar_32</code> template (there's
a new implementation for these templates in the new library).</li>
<li>The register containing the VF device id should be renamed
sriov_vf_device_id -&gt; vf_device_id and be moved to the <code>sriov</code> group.
It's value should be set with param init_val.</li>
<li>Remove the sriov_first_vf_offset and replace it by implementing the
<code>get_offset()</code> method in the <code>sriov</code> group.</li>
<li>Remove the sriov_vf_stride and replace it by implementing the
<code>get_stride()</code> method in the <code>sriov</code> group.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Set the param <code>sriov_virtual_functions</code> in each physical function that
instantiates the <code>defining_sriov_capability</code> template. This param should point
to an array of banks that instantiate the <code>vf_type_0_bank</code> template. In each
SR-IOV BAR register, set the param map_obj to an array of banks that is equal to
the number of virtual functions.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="root-complex-and-switches"><a href="#root-complex-and-switches">Root Complex and Switches</a></h3>
<p>PCIe port devices are used to construct Root Complexes (root ports) and Switches
(upstream and downstream ports). With the legacy PCI library, all the
connections for a PCIe port are handled through <code>pcie-bus</code>. The port would
reside on a bus by being placed in the <code>pci_devices</code> attribute of a <code>pcie-bus</code>,
and the bus underneath the port, the secondary bus, would be a (different)
<code>pcie_bus</code> that is set in the <code>secondary_bus</code> attribute of the port. These
connection schemes are typically handled in a component that creates multiple
instances of PCIe port devices and <code>pcie-bus</code>. With the new library, there is
more flexibility in regard to how to construct a Switch or Root Complex. For
instance, it is possible to construct the them as one Simics device, where all
the ports in the device would be subdevices. One could then place the downstream
port subdevice objects in the <code>devices</code> attribute of the upstream port subdevice
during <code>post_init</code>. However, it is still possible to construct them as a
component similarly to how it is done with the legacy library. The difference
being that one only needs to create object instances of the applicable ports and
connect them to each other using the <code>devices</code> attribute of the
<code>pcie-downstream-port</code> subdevice in each port, with no need for <code>pcie-bus</code> like
objects.</p>
<h4 id="host-bridges"><a href="#host-bridges">Host Bridges</a></h4>
<p>While PCIe ports are represented as PCI-PCI bridges in Switches and Root
Complexes and are PCIe function in their own right with a dedicated device/port
type in the PCI Express Capability Structure, Host Bridges in a Root Complex are
more loosely defined. A Host Bridge is defined is "Part of a Root Complex that
connects a host CPU or CPUs to a Hierarchy". How it is implemented is not
defined, meaning that different devices have likely chosen different ways of
implementing it. Sometimes the Host Bridge is represented as a function in the
Root Complex, other times that is not the case. This also means that the
implementations of Root Complex device models will not look the same in regard
to how the Host Bridge is handled.</p>
<p>An example would be the Host Bridge has been implemented as a function by
instantiating the <code>pcie_device</code> template from the legacy library and
implementing the legacy <code>pci_upstream</code> interface to handle upstream memory
transactions. Then it routes the transaction to some applicable device or memory
space. Migrating such a Host Bridge to the new library would entail first
treating it as a single function endpoint. Then remove the <code>pci_upstream</code>
interface implementation and instead implement the <code>translator</code> interface or
<code>transaction_translator</code> interface. Here, one has to keep in mind that the
legacy <code>pci_upstream</code> receives an old transaction type <code>generic_transaction_t</code>,
while the <code>transaction_translator</code> receives transaction of type <code>transaction_t</code>.
How these transactions differ from the older transaction type is out of the
scope of this documentation. An overview of transactions can be found in the
<a href="../model-builder-user-guide/transactions.html">Transactions</a> section of the
Model Builder User Guide.</p>
<h4 id="upstream-downstream-root-ports"><a href="#upstream-downstream-root-ports">Upstream/Downstream/Root Ports</a></h4>
<p>Similar process to the single function endpoint migration process. Steps that
differ will be mentioned below.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the device imports <code>pci\pcie-to-pcie</code> or <code>pci/bridge.dml</code>, remove these
imports (import <code>pcie/common.dml</code> instead).</li>
<li>Remove the parameters <code>forward_io</code>, <code>forward_io32</code>, <code>forward_mem</code>,
<code>forward_prefetchable</code>, <code>forward_prefetchable64</code> and <code>pci_hotplug</code>.</li>
<li>Instantiate one of the <code>pcie_root_port</code>, <code>pcie_downstream_port</code> or
<code>pcie_upstream_port</code>.</li>
<li>Hot-plug support is enabled by setting <code>param has_hotplug_capable_slot = true;</code> in the <code>exp</code> group of the PCI Express Capability structure that
should be present in the <code>pcie_config</code> bank.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="compatibility-with-legacy-devices"><a href="#compatibility-with-legacy-devices">Compatibility With Legacy Devices</a></h3>
<p>Devices (both endpoints and switches) implemented with the legacy PCI library
can be connected to root/downstream ports in a PCIe hierarchy implemented with
the new library. For this to work, the root/downstream port must ensure that the
instantiated downstream port object in the root/downstream port must be of the
class <code>pcie-downstream-port-legacy</code>. This can be achieved by setting the
<code>classname</code> param accordingly in the <code>downstream_port</code> <code>connect</code> of the device
that instantiated <code>pcie_&lt;root/upstream/downstream&gt;_port</code>.</p>
