<p>
   Note: this interface is internal and may change without notice.
</p><p>
   This interface is used to register callbacks to instrument transactions
   issued through a map target by the SIM_issue_transaction API call. This
   includes all <b>memory_space</b> objects handling transactions.
   The interface is only implemented by the <b>sim.transactions</b>
   object which serves all transactions.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>register_issue_cb</i></b> method registers a callback that is
   called whan a transaction is passed to a map target. This makes it
   possible to modify or replace the transaction before it reaches its
   destination. See the documentation of the
   <code>transaction_issue_cb_t</code> type for more information on now to
   handle the transaction.
</p><p>
   A <code>transaction_cb_handle_t</code> pointer is returned as a reference to
   the callback.
</p><p>
   The registered callbacks above will receive all types of accesses,
   read, write, or execute, from any initiator hitting any address range. It is
   up to the callback to filter the information if needed, e.g., to only trace
   read accesses.
</p><p>
   If more than one cell is used and multithreading is enabled, more that one
   callback can be issued at the same time.
</p><p>
   Normally, for transactions to ram/rom, these accesses can be bypassed by
   caching the destination object by using the
   <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface. Then these accesses cannot be
   monitored by the <code>transaction_subscribe</code> interface. However, it
   is possible to block this caching by using the
   <b><i>register_access_filter_cb</i></b> method of the
   <code>ram_access_subscribe</code> interface. This has typically severe
   impact on simulation speed, but allows user to monitor all transactions in
   the system. Note however that a real systems also reduces the transactions to
   memory by using caches, which normally is not modeled by
   Simics,
</p><p>
   The <b><i>remove_callback</i></b> method removes an earlier installed
   callback. The handle is used to identify the callback to be removed. The
   register functions above return such handle.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>enable_callback</i></b> and <b><i>disable_callback</i></b> methods
   temporarily enables and disables a previously installed callback. Note that
   this will not necessary speed up the simulation, since the caching may be
   blocked anyway. The handle is used to identify the callback. The register
   functions above return such handle.
