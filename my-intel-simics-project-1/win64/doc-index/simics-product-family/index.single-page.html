</section><section class="page" id="simics-products.html"><h1 id="simics-products.html:simics-products"><a href="#simics-products.html:simics-products">1 Simics Products</a></h1>
<p>The Simics product family is made up of multiple products and optional add-on products. For clarity the products are grouped into tools products and model products. This section defines what these products are and how they interact with each other. Please contact your Simics provider for the licensing terms of each product.</p>
<p>Features presented in this document may not always be supported for all architectures, for all target software and on all hosts.</p>
<h2 id="simics-products.html:simics-tool-products"><a href="#simics-products.html:simics-tool-products">1.1 Simics Tool Products</a></h2>
<h3 id="simics-products.html:simics"><a href="#simics-products.html:simics">1.1.1 Simics</a></h3>
<p>Simics is the primary product in the family. It provides the core simulation engine and user interface. With Simics, users can set up, run, control and inspect the virtual target system. User-written models and user-written extensions and fault injectors can run in Simics without those products available or installed.</p>
<p>The primary functions of Simics are the simulator itself with hardware-level inspection capabilities, the ability to save and restore checkpoints, record-replay functionality, snapshots, breakpoints, scripting, host connections (aka real networking), and simulation performance monitoring. Checkpoints contain the complete state of the system, thus when you save a checkpoint you are saving the entire state of the system, including the processors, devices, and all the software. When you restore a checkpoint, you begin executing from the exact place where you stopped executing when you saved that checkpoint.</p>
<p>Simics offers a fully featured command line which enables scripting of all Simics commands in CLI and Python. Simics also supports non-intrusive platform level debug or standalone debuggers such as the Intel* System Debugger, and the GNU Debugger (GDB) which connect to agents running on the virtual board to support application debug.</p>
<h3 id="simics-products.html:simics-analyzer"><a href="#simics-products.html:simics-analyzer">1.1.2 Simics Analyzer</a></h3>
<p>Simics Analyzer is a part of the Simics product which provides analysis and debugging capabilities for software applications for large distributed and heterogeneous systems as well as less complex systems. Information is primarily accessed via GUI views, as well as being accessible from the Simics command-line. The primary functionalities of Analyzer are Source Code Debugger, OS Awareness, Full System Process List, System Execution Time Line, and Code Coverage. More details can be found in the Feature List document. Simics Analyzer is a system-level debugger that provides debug across all targets in a Simics session. Simics Analyzer can debug heterogeneous systems from a single debug view, including different target architectures and operating systems.</p>
<p>While Simics provides a hardware-centric view of the system, Simics Analyzer extends this to a software-centric view. At its most basic Simics Analyzer extends the assembly level debug of Simics with stack frames and local variables. On supported architectures (ARM, Intel, PPC, and MIPS) this can be extended to source level debug for single context systems such as boot code and OS kernels. Source level debug can be extended to multi-context systems through the use of OS awareness. OS awareness, which must be enabled for each combination of Operating System and CPU type, is provided for most Wind River Operating Systems and Linux with many Simics Model Products, see the associated Target Guide for supported combinations. Users can enable OS awareness for additional Operating Systems using Simics Model Builder. Simics Analyzer requires no instrumentation or other changes to the target code.</p>
<h3 id="simics-products.html:simics-model-builder"><a href="#simics-products.html:simics-model-builder">1.1.3 Simics Model Builder</a></h3>
<p>Simics Model Builder is an add-on product in the Simics Family. Simics Model Builder allows users to create and modify the device models, virtual boards, and systems that Simics runs. Additionally it lets users adapt and extend Simics with new capabilities, allowing for customization, expanded use cases and integration into other tooling environments.</p>
<p>Simics Model Builder provides access to the Simics API documentation and frameworks needed to build device models, components, and system configurations in DML, C, C++, SystemC, Python, and any other language that can be compiled to a C-language API. The API includes frameworks for common types of devices such as PCI, I2C, and Ethernet. The Device Modeling Language (DML) allows device models to be created quickly and efficiently by providing appropriate constructs for common modeling tasks such as register banks, bit fields, and endianness. Additionally Simics Model Builder includes a kit for creating target system panels.</p>
<p>Simics Model Builder includes a SystemC Library that provides the ability to use SystemC TLM models within Simics, and to build SystemC models into Simics modules that can be run in Simics. SystemC Library-based models support most Simics CLI and GUI inspection features in the same way as models written directly for Simics. The SystemC Library supports SystemC 2.3, TLM-2.0, and both AT and LT-style SystemC models.</p>
<h4 id="simics-products.html:systemc-library-requirements"><a href="#simics-products.html:systemc-library-requirements">1.1.3.1 SystemC Library Requirements</a></h4>
<p>Simics supports running SystemC models, but because C++ does not have a standardized ABI, all SystemC Library modules as well as all SystemC models to be run inside Simics need to be compiled with exactly the same compiler, compiler version, and compiler flags. It works perfectly fine to include binary SystemC models as long as they are Accellera compliant and the compiler guidelines just outlined are followed.</p>
<p>Simics does not guarantee that the Simics SystemC Library API will not change between releases. Simics' SystemC support is still being gradually improved and a completely frozen API would limit what improvements can be made. A lot of effort will, however, be made to avoid changing the API. If a change is needed, the end-user effort will be minimized.</p>
<h2 id="simics-products.html:simics-model-products"><a href="#simics-products.html:simics-model-products">1.2 Simics Model Products</a></h2>
<p>Simics Virtual Platforms model the functionality of a real or imagined hardware and is required for useful operation of a Simics Tools product. A Simics Virtual Platform can be as simple or complex as the physical target system is. It can contain anything from a simple CPU and RAM, to a complex single board computer containing a multi-core processor, to a personal computer with graphics, disk drives, and mouse, or even to a complex network of computers and systems. Simics Virtual Platforms can connect to other Simics Virtual Platforms or to the real world via networks like Ethernet.</p>
<p>Simics Virtual Platforms are comprised of a combination of model Components, Processor/SoCs models, and device models. Simics Virtual Platforms may not model all possible functionality of the hardware as models are frequently written to support the needs of a specific Operating System or set of Operating Systems. Simics Virtual Platforms are often referred to as “targets”.</p>
<h3 id="simics-products.html:simics-quick-start-platform"><a href="#simics-products.html:simics-quick-start-platform">1.2.1 Simics Quick-Start Platform</a></h3>
<p>A Simics Quick-Start Platform or QSP includes a model of a generic machine with a real core. The point of the QSP is to enable basic simulation of code that is Architecture and OS dependent, but BSP independent. The set of devices provides what an OS requires to execute: interrupt controller, system controller, timers, memory, serial connection, Ethernet, real-time clock, disk and flash. The devices are PC compatible with x86 QSP. The QSPs include board support packages (BSP) that enable operating systems to run on the QSP.</p>
<h3 id="simics-products.html:simics-platforms"><a href="#simics-products.html:simics-platforms">1.2.2 Simics Platforms</a></h3>
<p>A Simics Platform (Model Library) is an add-on product to Simics that provides a collection of device models that a user can add to a Simics Virtual Platform using Simics Model Builder.</p>
</section><section class="page" id="standard-limitations.html"><h1 id="standard-limitations.html:standard-limitations"><a href="#standard-limitations.html:standard-limitations">2 Standard Limitations</a></h1>
<p>The standard limitations may apply to all model products.</p>
<ol>
<li>Error states and diagnostic registers typically only return default values corresponding to no error when read.</li>
<li>Performance counters will only return approximate values.</li>
<li>Hardware models are simplified for performance and complexity reasons, as long as target software in the Delivery Criteria can run unmodified on the model.</li>
<li>Only listed components or models will be implemented. Listed components or models can have limited functionality as long as the Delivery Criteria are fulfilled.</li>
<li>The default in-order execution model in Simics allows one instruction or exception to be simulated each simulated clock tick. This means that the simulated processors implicitly have a “firm” consistency model. Unless otherwise specified, the in-order execution model is the only execution model supported.</li>
<li>Simics is timing approximate; while Simics maintains a conceptual model of execution time, it will vary from the execution time of the same software running on a particular instance of physical hardware.</li>
<li>Processor and device models simulate the architecturally defined behavior, usually defined in a Programmers Reference Manual. The Simics implementation of processor and device models may differ from hardware implementations but will comply with the architecture unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li>For unusual cases, floating point calculations may have rounding errors, causing low order bits to differ from what is defined by architecture.</li>
<li>While error status registers are available in the simulation model, they typically have read-write semantics without any side effects. This means they are not set the simulation model and setting the registers will not cause any other effects in the model (such as triggering an interrupt or setting other registers).</li>
<li>Deviations from product specification will be noted in the release notes.</li>
</ol>

<p>This section provides a short but comprehensive list of the major product characteristics and features of Simics 6. For more detailed descriptions, refer to the complete Simics documentation.</p>
<h2 id="simics-feature-list.html:product-characteristics"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:product-characteristics">3.1 Product Characteristics</a></h2>
<div class="dl">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:deterministic-simulation"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:deterministic-simulation">Deterministic Simulation</a></span><br>
Simics is deterministic, forcing the exact same sequence of simulated instructions and device events to occur when rerunning the simulation. A deterministic simulation greatly simplifies debugging of target systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:non-intrusive-inspection"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:non-intrusive-inspection">Non-intrusive Inspection</a></span><br>
Observation of the simulated system by scripts, GUI, command line and actions like checkpoint creation is non-intrusive; i.e., the simulation does not change although observation is being done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:well-defined-api"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:well-defined-api">Well-defined API</a></span><br>
Simics exports two well-defined application programming interfaces (APIs) based on C available in C/C++. One for device modeling, the Device API and one for extending the simulator, the Simulator API. The two APIs are also available in Python, and there is a small Python-only API in addition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:api-and-abi-compatibility"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:api-and-abi-compatibility">API and ABI Compatibility</a></span><br>
Simics follows the standard semantic versioning rules. This implies that in minor releases (where only the second digit in the version number changes), there can be additions to the API, but not removals, so Simics maintains ABI compatibility. Hence there is no need to recompile modules when upgrading.</p>
<p>The API remains compatible with previous Simics releases. When building modules written for an older version of Simics, the API to use must be specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:modular-product-distribution"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:modular-product-distribution">Modular Product Distribution</a></span><br>
The Simics product is distributed as a single common base package, with several add-on packages. There is typically one add-on package for every modeled system architecture. Installing support for a new architecture for example does not require the base package to be re-installed. Add-on packages and the base package can be upgraded independently of each other within the same major release.</p>

<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:save-and-restore-of-checkpoints"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:save-and-restore-of-checkpoints">Save and Restore of Checkpoints</a></span><br>
The simulation state of an entire Simics simulation can be saved to disk and restored at a later time in a host independent format. Saving a checkpoint can be done at any point in time during a simulation. Checkpoints are stored in a combination of human readable configuration files and binary files for large state (such as simulated disk or memory) and can be annotated with a clear text description. Checkpoints are incremental by default, i.e. only data that has changed since the last checkpoint is saved. But independent, stand-alone checkpoints can also be created. Only the simulated state is saved is a checkpoint; session data such as simulator preferences and statistics is not. It is also possible to include a recording of user and network input in a checkpoint. Old checkpoints can usually be loaded into newer versions of Simics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:snapshots"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:snapshots">Snapshots</a></span><br>
The simulation state can also be saved as in-memory snapshots. This is similar to checkpoints but is used within one simulation session. Snapshots can be loaded later, thus jumping between different points in simulation time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:save-and-restore-of-persistent-data"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:save-and-restore-of-persistent-data">Save and Restore of Persistent Data</a></span><br>
Persistent data, such as disk images and NVRAM contents that survive power-cycling, can be saved and restored at any time without the need to save the complete simulated state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:dynamic-machine-configuration-system"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:dynamic-machine-configuration-system">Dynamic Machine Configuration System</a></span><br>
Simics simulations are configured using objects and object attributes. The configuration language is used to setup machines and connect machines via networks. Configurations are host independent and can be created programmatically. Although editing by hand is possible configurations are typically created by tools, such as the component system. Objects can be added to and removed from the simulation at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:high-level-component-configuration-system"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:high-level-component-configuration-system">High-Level Component Configuration System</a></span><br>
The primary configuration system uses components that represent actual replaceable hardware units, such as mother-boards, disks, keyboards, PCI cards and network links. Components support hot-plugging if applicable, and they also make sure that only valid hardware configurations are set up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:hierarchical-configuration-system"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:hierarchical-configuration-system">Hierarchical Configuration System</a></span><br>
The configuration system supports hierarchies of objects as a way to impose structure of large and complex system. Some configuration aspects are inherited based on the hierarchy, simplifying setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:recording-of-asynchronous-input"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:recording-of-asynchronous-input">Recording of Asynchronous Input</a></span><br>
Simics can record all input coming from the real world, allowing replay of a simulated session. Since the simulation is deterministic, a session can be rerun with the exact same result. Asynchronous input includes network traffic, serial port communication, keyboard and mouse input. The recording can also be saved separately or together with a checkpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:hybrid-simulation"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:hybrid-simulation">Hybrid Simulation</a></span><br>
The Hybrid Simulation feature allows integration between Simics and an external, much more timing accurate simulation model. As the accurate model will run significantly slower than a Simics functional model, the functional model can be used for workload positioning. Once this has been done, the simulation state can be transferred (and transformed) into the accurate model, and simulation can be continued.</p>
<p>Integration of external timing accurate models require specific development, please contact Simics Support for more information.</p>

The Simics Quick-Start Platform for x86 is a model of a standard Intel®-based personal computer (PC). The virtual platform boots from a TianoCore-based open-source UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) and can run modern Linux, Windows*, and other operating system distributions. The platform is highly configurable and includes aspects like the number and types of processor cores, memory size, disks, network setup, PCIe* cards, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:network-services"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:network-services">Network Services</a></span><br>
Simics includes a virtual network server which provides a number of common network services over IPv4, and in some cases IPv6, on Ethernet networks. These include BOOTP, DHCP, DHCPv6, DNS, FTP, NTP, RARP, and TFTP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:computer-industry-standards"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:computer-industry-standards">Computer Industry Standards</a></span><br>
A wide range of common computer standards are supported and implemented in Simics in some form. There is often generic support for common protocols that can be extended for specific devices.</p>

Simics can utilize more that one host core to get improved simulation performance for both target systems that can be partitioned into multiple machines, called <em>cells</em> in Simics, and for tightly-coupled multi-processor target systems based on the ARM, PPC and x86 architectures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:distributed-simulation"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:distributed-simulation">Distributed Simulation</a></span><br>
A simulation can be distributed over several Simics processes, either running on the same real host or on multiple networked hosts. A distributed simulation keeps the determinism of non-distributed simulations, and maintains global time across all processes. Simulations can be distributed at link boundaries, such as Ethernet and serial port connections.</p>

The Simics VMP feature can improve the simulated performance by utilizing the hardware virtualization support found in modern Intel® processors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="simics-feature-list.html:dt:hypersimulation"><a href="#simics-feature-list.html:dt:hypersimulation">Hypersimulation</a></span><br>
Hypersimulation, also known as idle-loop-optimization, improves the performance of the simulation by doing fast forward of the virtual time when the target system is running code without side-effects. The system automatically identifies many hypersimulation opportunities of moderate complexity. For more complex opportunities, users can adapt the hypersimulation to match their own target code.</p>

The memory-space abstraction in Simics supports a generic 64-bit address space where memory and devices can be mapped in. Objects can be mapped at multiple addresses and be mapped overlapping with different priorities. Several common byte-swapping operations are supported for mappings. Memory spaces can be mapped in other spaces, with optional address translation being performed between them.</li>

Simics can detect when processes start and exist on the simulated machine, and keep track of what process that is currently active. Process tracking is useful for single process debugging, or when collecting statistics on a per process basis. Since knowledge about the target OS is needed, the process tracker has to be extended to support new operating systems. There is also a simple process tracker that only differentiates between user and supervisor mode that can be used if the OS is not supported. See Analyzer User's Guide for list of supported systems, including Linux, UEFI and VxWorks.</li>
