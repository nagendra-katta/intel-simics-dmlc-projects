<p>Intel® Simics® Simulator 7 is binary compatible with recent models from version 6 but it is not directly compatible with neither version 4.8 nor 5. However, the simulator supports the same structure of installation and multi-user configuration, so upgrading should be simple.</p>
<p>For version 4.8, select the 4.8 API to get access to deprecated parts of the API. This is described in the <a href="../simics-migration-guide/index.html"><em>Simics Migration Guide</em></a>.</p>
<p>For both version 4.8 and 5, some Python source code may have to be updated before recompiling.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-minor-7-releases"><a href="#upgrading-minor-7-releases">4.2 Upgrading Minor 7 Releases</a></h2>
<p>Version 7 releases are binary compatible, so nothing special needs to be done when upgrading.
Unless specifically mentioned in their <em>Release Notes</em>, add-on packages should work with any installation of Simics Base, version 7.
A more detailed description of compatibility issues for user-created modules is available in the <a href="../simics-migration-guide/index.html"><em>Simics Migration Guide</em></a>.</p>
