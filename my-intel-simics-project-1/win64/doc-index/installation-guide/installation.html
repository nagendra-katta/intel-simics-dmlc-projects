<p>As a customer you should have received instructions that describes which packages to install and where to find them. If this is not the case, contact your provider to obtain this information.</p>
<p>For the installation, use the Intel® Simics® Package Manager (ISPM). ISPM can be used to check for updated packages, download and install/uninstall, and manage Intel Simics Projects, also called "user projects". It supports both command line (batch) mode and GUI mode.</p>
<p>The simulator is delivered in <em>packages</em>, each one containing different parts of the functionality. There is a <em>Simics Base</em> package and several add-on packages. The most common packages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Simics Base</em> package which provides the simulation engine and the user interface, as well as a library of standard models.</li>
<li>Add-on packages, one for each virtual platform, usually containing CPU cores and various devices. The virtual platform is the simulation platform and the model of the physical target hardware that is being simulated.</li>
<li>The <em>Quick-Start Platform for x86</em> (QSP-x86) add-on package is meant for training, application development, demos, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once ISPM has installed Simics Base and one or more platform packages it can create user projects. A user project is a directory for adding user files and developing simulation models, and is typically set up for a combination of a few packages of certain versions. Thus such projects enable users to work with different package combinations just by switching between projects.</p>
<p>New users are suggested to study the <a href="../getting-started/index.html"><em>Getting Started</em></a> guide which describes how to launch the simulator and run the QSP-x86 platform.</p>
<p>ISPM can, at any time, install more packages, other versions of already installed packages, or uninstall packages or versions no longer used.</p>
<h2 id="installing-vmp"><a href="#installing-vmp">3.1 Installing VMP</a></h2>
<p>VMP uses direct execution to simulate x86 systems at near native speed. A kernel module is needed to communicate directly with the host hardware, and installing the kernel module requires a separate step.</p>
<p>The VMP feature requires that the host machine running the simulator has the Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT) for IA-32, Intel® 64, and that Intel® Architecture (Intel® VT-x) is enabled in the host machine firmware (the UEFI/BIOS) and visible to the VMXMON kernel module.</p>
<p>For more information and known limitations, see <a href="../simics-user-guide/index.html"><em>Simics User's Guide</em></a>, chapter "Simulation Performance".</p>
<h3 id="linux"><a href="#linux">3.1.1 Linux</a></h3>
<p>Installing and managing VMP kernel modules requires sudo privileges. Installing will compile the kernel module and therefore also requires an environment to build kernel modules. Which packages you need for building kernel modules depend on the distribution of Linux that you are using, but at least for certain Red Hat based distributions you would need <code>gcc-c++</code>, <code>kernel-headers</code>, and <code>kernel-devel</code>. Change directory to the user project and run:</p>
<pre><code>[project]$ bin/vmp-kernel-install
</code></pre>
<p>The script will compile and persistently install the kernel modules that are used by VMP. It will echo what needs to be done, which involves running scripts in the <code>[simics]/vmxmon/scripts/</code> directory.</p>
<p>Disable VMP temporarily by running the <code>bin/vmp-kernel-unload</code> script, and enable VMP with the <code>bin/vmp-kernel-load</code> script. Permanently uninstall VMP from your host by running the <code>bin/vmp-kernel-uninstall</code> script.</p>
<p>If the installation is read-only, or if you for some other reason want to have the built VMP artifacts outside of the installation, you can give a directory to the relevant VMP scripts, for example:</p>
<pre><code>[project]$ bin/vmp-kernel-install /somewhere/directory
[project]$ bin/vmp-kernel-load /somewhere/directory
</code></pre>
<h3 id="windows"><a href="#windows">3.1.2 Windows</a></h3>
<p>The kernel module can be loaded and unloaded by running the <code>bin\vmp-kernel-load.bat</code> respective <code>bin\vmp-kernel-unload.bat</code> scripts as administrator. To do that, open a command shell as administrator and run:</p>
<pre><code>[project]&gt; bin\vmp-kernel-load.bat
</code></pre>
<p>Another way to perform the same action would be to right-click on <code>vmp-kernel-load.bat</code> and select run as administrator.</p>
<p>The <code>/AUTO</code> and <code>/DEMAND</code> options select the start option for the VMP service. With <code>/AUTO</code> (default), the service will be available after restart whereas with <code>/DEMAND</code> makes the service available just until shutdown or reboot, and then VMP has to be loaded again when needed.</p>
<p>If the script fails, see the Windows event log for more information. The most common reason is that Intel® VT-x technology or the NX feature is not enabled in the UEFI/BIOS. The kernel module will also fail to load if the Hyper-V feature is enabled.</p>
