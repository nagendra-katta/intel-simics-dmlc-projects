<h2 id="hardware-requirements"><a href="#hardware-requirements">2.1 Hardware requirements</a></h2>
<p>The minimum hardware requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>64-bit Intel® Architecture processor, either Haswell or newer performance core ("big core") architecture, or Gracemont or newer efficiency core (Atom) architecture.</li>
<li>VMP requires that Intel® Architecture (Intel® VT-x) is enabled in UEFI/BIOS and visible to the VMXMON kernel module.</li>
<li>16 GB of RAM.</li>
<li>8 GB of disk space.</li>
</ul>
<p>More RAM and/or disk is often necessary, depending on the requirements of the simulated machine.</p>
<p>For best performance, we recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>A host with least 32 GB of RAM.</li>
<li>A host processor with a high clock speed, 4GHz or more.</li>
<li>At least two host cores per simulation running simultaneously (in
particular, check processor allocations in containers and virtual
machines).</li>
<li>Since a more recent host processor will run faster than older
generations, try to use the most modern Intel® Architecture processor possible.</li>
<li>Use fast local storage for the simulator swap.</li>
<li>Faster memory (RAM) can help, but is not as important as the processor
core itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>For maximum performance when simulating Intel® Architecture targets, the Intel®
Simics® Simulator can use virtualization (also known as VMP or
VMXMON). The use of virtualization requires an Intel processor with
Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT) for IA-32, Intel® 64 and
Intel® Architecture (Intel® VT-x).</p>
<ul>
<li>The best performance from virtualization is obtained when the host
is as close to the target as possible. In particular, simulating an
Intel® Architecture Server is usually best done on an Intel®
Architecture Server host of the most recent generation.</li>
<li>Note that running Intel® Simics® simulations in a virtual machine
typically prevents Intel® VT-x from being used or cause it to run
with a significant reduction in speed. If isolation between
simulator instances is desired, use containers on Linux instead as
they normally allow the use of custom drivers on the host.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linux-64-bit"><a href="#linux-64-bit">2.2 Linux (64-bit)</a></h2>
<p><strong>Run Time Requirements</strong></p>
<p>A modern Linux distribution (<em><a href="#note1">1</a></em>), with at least</p>
<ul>
<li>GLIBC 2.22 or later.</li>
<li>GTK 2.24 or later — for the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supported examples are Suse Linux Enterprise Server 12 (and newer) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (and newer).</p>
<p>When running Simics with a user provided Python, or when using Simics as a Python module, Python version 3.10 or later is required.</p>
<p><strong>Model Builder Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GCC 6.3 compiler. Recommended to use GCC 12 or later.</li>
<li>Typical GNU-based development environment, with GNU Make 4.1 or later.</li>
<li>Optional: CMake version 3.4 or later.</li>
<li>For SystemC*, see footnote <em>(<a href="#note2">2</a>)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microsoft-windows-64-bit"><a href="#microsoft-windows-64-bit">2.3 Microsoft Windows (64-bit)</a></h2>
<p><strong>Run Time Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, or later.</li>
<li>Visual Studio run-time libraries: <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe</a>.</li>
<li>Simics Base and the libraries it ships are built for the Windows Universal C Runtime (UCRT).</li>
</ul>
<p>When running Simics with a user provided Python, or when using Simics as a Python module, Python version 3.10 or later is required.</p>
<p><strong>Model Builder Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MinGW GCC 6.3 or Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 compiler <em>(<a href="#note3">3</a>)</em>. Recommended to use MinGW GCC 12 or later, built for UCRT and POSIX threads.</li>
<li>MinGW development environment, with GNU Make 4.1 or later.</li>
<li>Optional: CMake version 3.4 or later.</li>
<li>For SystemC*, see footnote <em>(<a href="#note2">2</a>)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="python-requirements"><a href="#python-requirements">2.4 Python requirements</a></h2>
<p>Simics needs a Python installation to run. Such an installation is
provided in the Simics package with number 1033, but a user can also
use another Python with version 3.10 or greater.</p>
<p>The Python packages listed in <code>requirements.txt</code> in the
Simics-Base package must be made available to Simics. For instance,
they can be installed using the <code>pip</code> package manager, which
is part of any standard Python installation.</p>
<p>If Simics package 1033 is installed, Simics will normally find and
use Python from there. Otherwise it will look for a Python on the
host. On Linux, it will try using <code>python3</code>, expecting it to
be in <code>PATH</code>. On Windows, it will query the Registry for the
Python installation path.</p>
<p>To use a specific Python when running Simics,
the <code>SIMICS_PYTHON</code> environment variable can be set to the
path to a Python binary.</p>
