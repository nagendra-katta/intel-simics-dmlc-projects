<p>This section demonstrates how to utilize <code>snoop</code> and <code>sloop</code> for monitoring
complex conditions.</p>
<h2 id="problem-statement"><a href="#problem-statement">3.1 Problem Statement</a></h2>
<p>Imagine a memory-space <code>ms</code> with a device mapped such that writing <em>sz</em> bytes
(where <em>sz</em> ≤ 8) to an address <code>addr</code> appends these bytes to a FIFO queue.
Our objective is to continue simulation until a total of <code>N</code> bytes have been
accumulated in the FIFO.
For example, if <code>N</code> is 10, the condition would be met after
two writes of 4 bytes and two writes of 1 byte.
We aim to design a coroutine <code>wait_accumulated_writes</code> that behaves
as expected when invoked like this:</p>
<pre><code>sloop.run_until_complete(
    wait_accumulated_writes(ms, address=addr, length=8, threshold=N))
</code></pre>
<p>The following sections describe different strategies for implementing the
<code>wait_accumulated_writes</code> function, along with their pros and cons.</p>
<h2 id="repeated-sloop-wait"><a href="#repeated-sloop-wait">3.2 Repeated <code>sloop.wait</code></a></h2>
<p>The initial method involves iteratively awaiting the snooper's trigger:</p>
<pre><code>async def wait_accumulated_writes(memory_space, addr, length, threshold):
    tot_written = 0
    one_access = snoop.MemoryWrite(memory_space, addr, length)
    while tot_written &lt; threshold:
        access = await sloop.wait(one_access)
        tot_written += len(access.value)
</code></pre>
<p>While generally effective, this method has a notable drawback:
it can sometimes miss write operations that occur in rapid succession.</p>
<p>To recapitulate, a snooper is a low-level construct for registering callbacks.
These callbacks are typically invoked during simulation,
often in the midst of a CPU instruction.
In contrast, <code>sloop</code> coroutines operate independently of the simulation;
they execute logic in a more permissive context (Global Context),
where simulation is temporarily halted.
This ensures that the simulation state can be inspected
and modified without concurrency issues.</p>
<p>When the coroutine encounters <code>await sloop.wait(MemoryAccess(...))</code>,
the <code>sloop.wait</code> function registers a callback with the snooper,
and the <code>await</code> statement pauses the coroutine,
allowing simulation to continue.
Upon a write operation, the callback is triggered, it unregisters itself,
and uses the <code>SIM_run_alone</code> function to request that the Simics scheduler
temporarily halts the simulation, enabling the coroutine to proceed.
However, this pause may not take effect immediately — for instance,
the current CPU may need to finish its current instruction. Consequently,
if two accesses occur during the same instruction,
the second may be missed if the snooper is deactivated,
leading to an inaccurate total size count.</p>
<p>This method is still viable under certain conditions.
For example, if you know that each write to an address
is triggered by a distinct instruction and executed by the same CPU,
the coroutine will have sufficient time to reactivate the snooper
between writes.</p>
<h2 id="sloop-tracer"><a href="#sloop-tracer">3.3 <code>sloop.Tracer</code></a></h2>
<p>The second method uses the <code>Tracer</code> asynchronous context manager to
maintain snooper activation between writes:</p>
<pre><code>async def wait_accumulated_writes(memory_space, addr, length, threshold):
    tot_written = 0
    with sloop.Tracer(
            snoop.MemoryWrite(memory_space, addr, length)) as tr:
        async for access in tr:
            tot_written += len(access.value)
            if tot_written &gt;= threshold:
                break
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Tracer</code> object activates the snooper once and retains
all write events in an internal queue.
If multiple writes are triggered by the same instruction,
they are queued, and the <code>async for</code> loop processes them without interruption.
When the queue is empty, the loop pauses,
allowing the simulation to resume until the next write occurs.</p>
<p>Although this method is functionally robust,
it still requires starting and stopping the simulation for each memory write,
which can significantly slow down the simulation.</p>
<h2 id="compound-snoopers"><a href="#compound-snoopers">3.4 Compound Snoopers</a></h2>
<p>The first two methods express the logic for aggregating write sizes
within the coroutine's control flow, necessitating simulation
pauses between writes.
This can be costly, especially with multiple CPUs involved.</p>
<p>The third method introduces <em>compound snoopers</em> that execute this
logic directly within the simulation thread.
These snoopers are composed of a snooper and a function that
is called synchronously when the snooper yields a value.
By chaining such snoopers, we create a single snooper that
triggers exactly when the final condition is met,
so that a single <code>sloop.wait</code> call suffices.</p>
<pre><code>async def wait_accumulated_writes(memory_space, addr, length, threshold):
    writes = snoop.MemoryWrite(memory_space, addr, length)
    # This snooper yields lengths of individual writes
    lengths = snoop.Map(lambda access: len(access.value), writes)
    # This snooper yields accumulated total lengths
    acc_lengths = snoop.Accumulate(lengths, lambda a, b: a + b)
    # This snooper yields when accumulated length exceeds the threshold
    exceed = snoop.Filter(lambda length: length &gt;= threshold, acc_lengths)
    await sloop.wait(exceed)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="sloop-callbackscope"><a href="#sloop-callbackscope">3.5 <code>sloop.CallbackScope</code></a></h2>
<p>While compound snoopers offer a coding style familiar
from functional programming,
there are scenarios where an imperative style with direct callbacks
is more suitable.
The <code>CallbackScope</code> asynchronous context manager facilitates
this within a coroutine:</p>
<pre><code>async def wait_accumulated_writes(memory_space, addr, length, threshold):
    tot_written = 0
    done = sloop.get_running_loop().create_future()
    def cb(access):
        nonlocal tot_written
        tot_written += len(access.value)
        if tot_written &gt;= threshold:
            done.set_result(None)
    async with sloop.CallbackScope(
            snoop.MemoryWrite(memory_space, addr, length), cb):
        await done
</code></pre>
<p>In this scenario, the callback <code>cb</code> is invoked directly from
the simulation thread after each write.
When the threshold is reached,
the callback signals the coroutine using a <code>sloop.Future</code> object.</p>
<p><code>CallbackScope</code> is preferred over the low-level <code>MemoryWrite.add_callback</code> in
coroutine implementations,
as it automatically manages cancellation and exceptions, ensuring robustness.</p>
<p>There is no significant difference in performance between using a
<code>CallbackScope</code> and compound snoopers.</p>
<h2 id="custom-snooper"><a href="#custom-snooper">3.6 Custom Snooper</a></h2>
<p>The final method involves creating a custom snooper:</p>
<pre><code>class AccumulatedWrites(snoop.MemoryWrite):
    def __init__(self, memory_space, addr, length, threshold):
        super().__init__(memory_space, addr, length)
        self.threshold = threshold
    def add_callback(self, cb, exc_cb):
        tot_written = 0
        def write_cb(access):
            nonlocal tot_written
            tot_written += len(access.value)
            while tot_written &gt;= self.threshold:
                tot_written -= self.threshold
                cb(None)
        return super().add_callback(write_cb, exc_cb)

async def wait_accumulated_writes(memory_space, addr, length, threshold):
    await sloop.wait(AccumulatedWrites(
        memory_space, addr, length, threshold))
</code></pre>
<p>This method offers the most flexibility,
as the <code>AccumulatedWrites</code> snooper can be used independently
or combined with other compound snoopers.
For example, <code>sloop.CallbackScope(AccumulatedWrites(...), cb)</code>
could provide a callback within the simulation thread for every
N bytes written.</p>
<p>However, writing your own custom snooper requires a deeper understanding
of low-level concepts such as callback handles, exception handling,
and execution contexts.
It also carries the risk of subtle bugs if not implemented correctly,
whereas higher-level methods typically offer better error detection.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary">3.7 Summary</a></h2>
<p>We have explored five distinct methods for monitoring a sequence
of simulation events.
The first choice should normally be either
repeated <code>sloop.wait</code> or <code>sloop.Tracer</code>,
as they are straightforward but may have performance implications.
If performance is a concern, then compound snoopers or
<code>sloop.CallbackScope</code> may be more appropriate,
depending on the complexity of the control flow and the use case.
Compound snoopers are well-suited for scenarios where a
functional programming style can elegantly manage event sequences.
In contrast, <code>sloop.CallbackScope</code> is advantageous for more complex
control flows that require maintaining state or handling side effects,
where an imperative approach is more natural.
A fifth valid option is a custom snooper, but this is seldom the best choice.</p>
