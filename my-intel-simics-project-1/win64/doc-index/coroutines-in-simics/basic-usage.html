<p>Imagine you want to test that a system boots to a login prompt on its
serial console (<code>board.serconsole.con</code>), and that requesting the <code>root</code> user
brings you to a <code>#</code> prompt without asking for a password.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this test could be implemented in the Simics CLI
using a script branch; after loading the target (e.g. <code>qsp-x86/firststeps</code>),
the test might look like:</p>
<pre><code>$booted = false
script-branch {
        bp.console_string.wait-for board.serconsole.con "login: "
        board.serconsole.con.input "root\n"
        bp.console_string.wait-for board.serconsole.con "# "
        echo "login successful"
        $booted = true
        stop
}
run 30 s
expect $booted true
</code></pre>
<p>With the <code>sloop</code> coroutine library, you can express the same test as follows:</p>
<pre><code>import snoop
import sloop
async def boot_to_login(console):
    await sloop.wait(snoop.ConsoleString(console, "login: "))
    console.iface.con_input.input_str("root\n")
    await sloop.wait(snoop.ConsoleString(console, "# "))
    print("login successful")

sloop.run_until_complete(boot_to_login(conf.board.serconsole.con))
</code></pre>
<p>This example highlights the separation of concerns in a <code>sloop</code> coroutine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snooping Primitives</strong>:
The <code>ConsoleString</code> class from the <code>snoop</code> library specifies
<em>what</em> to wait for, such as strings appearing on a console.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Control Flow</strong>: The <code>sloop.wait</code> coroutine defines
<em>how</em> to wait for these strings,
by pausing until the specified string appears.</li>
<li><strong>Simulation Control</strong>:
The console interaction is abstracted into the <code>login</code> coroutine.
At the top level, <code>run_until_complete</code> is used to start this coroutine
and run simulation until it finishes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="time-and-timeouts"><a href="#time-and-timeouts">2.1 Time and Timeouts</a></h2>
<p>The example above does not have an explicit timeout; if boot fails,
the coroutine will just hang, eventually triggering a timeout in the test
framework.
It is better to let the test fail if the boot hasn't finished
within a certain amount of simulated time.</p>
<p>In <code>snoop</code>, simulated time is always tied to a specific CPU or clock object.
Typically, there's an obvious choice of clock for a test,
and it's convenient to store a time snooper in a variable:</p>
<pre><code>s = snoop.Seconds(conf.board.mb.cpu0, 1)
</code></pre>
<p>Time snoopers can be scaled using multiplication, enabling constructs like:</p>
<pre><code>async def wait_three_seconds():
    await sloop.wait(3 * s)
</code></pre>
<p>To handle scenarios where a boot process might hang,
you can employ the <code>sloop.timeout</code> asynchronous context manager
to enforce a timeout.
The above example can be adjusted as follows:</p>
<pre><code>async def login_with_timeout(console):
    async with sloop.timeout(30 * s):
        await sloop.wait(snoop.ConsoleString(console, "login: "))
        console.iface.con_input.input_str("root\n")
        await sloop.wait(snoop.ConsoleString(console, "# "))
        print("login successful")

sloop.run_until_complete(login_with_timeout(conf.board.serconsole.con))
</code></pre>
<p>Timeouts can be nested, allowing you to set an overarching timeout
for the entire boot process and additional,
shorter timeouts for specific milestones,
thus identifying failures more promptly.</p>
<h2 id="simulation-control"><a href="#simulation-control">2.2 Simulation Control</a></h2>
<p>In the context of simulation, a coroutine acts as a participant and is not
responsible for starting or stopping the simulation itself. The progression of
the simulation is ultimately controlled by the user, who may interactively start
or stop the simulation, or execute a script — often a test case —
that drives the simulation forward.
In <code>sloop</code>, a user or script can initiate a coroutine by
using <code>sloop.global_event_loop().create_task()</code> to create a background task,
or <code>sloop.run_until_complete()</code> to run the simulation until the coroutine has
completed its execution.</p>
<p>For tests that incorporate asynchronous logic, a dual approach is advantageous:
initially, <code>create_task</code> is used to encapsulate the entire test case within a
top-level coroutine task.
This task is then stored in a global variable,
and <code>run_until_complete</code> is subsequently called to run the simulation until the
coroutine reaches its end:</p>
<pre><code>boot_task = sloop.global_event_loop().create_task(
    login_with_timeout(conf.board.serconsole.con))
sloop.run_until_complete(boot_task)
</code></pre>
<p>During interactive test sessions, you might need to pause the simulation to
examine the system state or to set breakpoints for debugging purposes.
If the simulation is halted,
the <code>run_until_complete</code> invocation will be interrupted,
but the test task will persist as long as it was created as a separate entity.
This grants complete control over the simulation,
allowing you to resume or stop it at your discretion.
Alternatively, you can call
<code>run_until_complete</code> on the test task again to resume and carry the
test through to its conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="handling-system-resets"><a href="#handling-system-resets">2.3 Handling System Resets</a></h2>
<p>To ensure the auto-login process is resilient to system reboots,
you should use a <em>task group</em>:</p>
<pre><code>async def always_auto_login(console, reset):
    while True:
        async with sloop.TaskGroup() as tg:
            task = tg.create_task(boot_to_login(console))
            await sloop.wait(reset)
            task.cancel()
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>reset</code> is a snooper that detects system reboots.
Utilizing a task group's <code>create_task</code> method ensures that the task
is cleanly restarted after each reboot. Without a task group,
an unexpected error could cause the task to persist through a reset,
potentially leading to multiple instances of the coroutine
running simultaneously.</p>
