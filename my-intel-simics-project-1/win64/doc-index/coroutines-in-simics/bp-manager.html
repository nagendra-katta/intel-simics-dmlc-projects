<p>The breakpoint manager, represented by the <code>bp</code> configuration object, provides
a number of <em>breakpoint types</em>, which are similar in spirit to snoopers: Like a
snooper, a breakpoint type represents an observable simulation event, and
provides various options for awaiting or tracing this event.</p>
<p>It is usually preferable to use snoopers rather than breakpoint types, but in
some cases breakpoint types may offer features that snoopers don't.</p>
<p>For this reason, the <code>bp-manager</code>
module provides a generic wrapper that turns a breakpoint type into a snooper:
The Python class <code>simmod.bp_manager.snooper.BP(obj, *args, **kwargs)</code> is a
snooper based on the breakpoint type represented by the configuration object
<code>obj</code>, where <code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code> are interpreted as CLI arguments to the
breakpoint type. For instance, the command <code>bp.log.run-until object = sim substr = "a.*b" -regexp</code>, which has a direct Python wrapping
<code>conf.bp.log.cli_cmds.run_until(object=conf.sim, substr='a.*b', regexp=True)</code>,
can be wrapped in a snooper as
<code>simmod.bp_manager.snooper.BP(conf.bp.log, object=conf.sim, substr='a.*b', regexp=True)</code>;</p>
<p>A breakpoint manager based snooper can sometimes offer a pragmatic interim solution
while migrating a script branch to a sloop coroutine; however, please note that
there is often more direct approach based on native snoopers. For instance, the
example above can be expressed using the <code>Filter</code> snooper:
<code>snoop.Filter(lambda msg: re.search('a.*b', msg.message), snoop.Log(conf.sim))</code></p>
