  This chapter describes issues related to migrating to Simics 7 from Simics
  6. For information about what is new in Simics 7, read the product release
  notes.

  When launching Simics 5 or 6 on Linux, the shell script file
  <code>$HOME/.simics-5.sh</code> was sourced if it existed.
  In Simics 7 this is no longer done.

  When migrating to Simics API 7 from Simics API 6, there are a few differences
  that may need to be addressed for DML code or modules. It is important to note
  that the migration to the Simics 7 API can be performed gradually. A single
  module in a large system can be migrated individually and each feature to be
  migrated can be migrated individually.
</p><p>
  A comprehensive description of migration concerns and a process for migration
  is documented in Appendix C of the <em>Device Modeling Language 1.4
  Reference Manual</em>. The below provide a brief list and brief
  description of some items to be addressed in the migration.
</p><p>
  </p><ul>
  <li>The <code>transaction</code> interface was introduced in API 6, and will
  eventually replace the <code>io_memory</code> interface. In API 7, bank objects
  will by default implement the <code>transaction</code> interface.</li>

  <li>Log statements in shared methods now log on the nearest enclosing
  configuration object like non-shared methods. A common example of this, is
  that logs from certain register/field templates which appeared on the device
  objects in API 6 will instead appear on the bank objects in API 7. </li>

  <li>The common error of mixing up log level and log group in log statements gives
  a warning in Simics API 7.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  For migrating DML 1.2 code, please refer to Appendix B of the <em>Device
  Modeling Language 1.4 Reference Manual</em>.
