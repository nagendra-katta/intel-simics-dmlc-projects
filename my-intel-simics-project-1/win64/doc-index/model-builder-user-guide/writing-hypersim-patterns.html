<p>For an introduction on what <em>hypersimulation</em> is, see the <em>Simics User Guide</em>, in the <em>Performance</em> chapter.</p>
<p>Simics has a module called <code>hypersim-pattern-matcher</code>, that manages a number of specific idle-loop machine code patterns, <em>hypersim-patterns</em>. The theory of operation is that each pattern registers itself into a global database, from where the matcher selects the patterns that matches the simulated architecture. The matcher then insert hooks into those processors to detect when the binary code matches any of the patterns. If a match is found, an execute breakpoint is set at this address to allow the pattern to fast-forward the simulation every time the CPU reaches the pattern.</p>
<p>The <em>Automatic Hypersimulation</em> feature in Simics 6 reduces the need to write manual patterns. The ability to detect loops which can be hypersimulated is part of the JIT compiler for PPC, ARM and MIPS processor models. Loops that can be detected must fit into one compilation unit and may not contain any store instruction in the loop path. Automatically detected loops have lower insertion overhead and simulates faster compared to using the hypersim-pattern-matcher. Consequently, old manual written patterns, describing simple loops, might now be detected automatically with increased performance. These manual patterns should therefore be removed.</p>
<h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview">49.1 Overview</a></h2>
<h3 id="locating-idle-loops"><a href="#locating-idle-loops">49.1.1 Locating Idle Loops</a></h3>
<p>With <em>idle loops</em> we mean any kind of loop that does not calculate any value; this include spin-locks, busy-wait loops, variable polling, and timing loops.</p>
<p>The easiest way to locate the idle loop is simply to pause the simulation when it appears to do nothing but still takes time to simulate. Chances are high that the CPU is stopped somewhere in the idle loop. You can then use the <code>step-instruction</code> command to single step and inspect the instructions being executed. If you see a repetitive pattern here, there is a small loop that could possibly be optimized. The <code>-r</code> flag to <code>step-instruction</code> will print register updates, it is helpful to understand if there is a counter involved in the loop.</p>
<p>The next step is to verify that it only accesses RAM on predictable addresses. Loops that polls a device is not possible to hypersimulate, unless the device accesses are free from side-effects. To inspect this, you can insert a tracer using <code>new-tracer</code> and <code>trace-io</code>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-pattern-classes"><a href="#creating-pattern-classes">49.1.2 Creating Pattern Classes</a></h3>
<p>Each pattern should register itself as a Simics Class with certain interfaces and attributes. Please see section <a class="reference" href="#object-structure">49.2.4</a> for detailed information.</p>
<p>The pattern matcher accept patterns in two different formats. The generic format is as a hexadecimal or binary string. However, since architectures with constant-width instructions of 4 bytes are common, there is a simpler format as a list of (value, mask) pairs. This form specifies the instruction opcodes and masks to match in 32-bit big endian format.</p>
<p>The simplest option is to convert the loop into a pattern that should match exactly, but more general patterns are also possible, for example by using any register, and the instructions that are not part of the loop could be left out. However, we recommend keeping the pattern exact until you actually face another loop which could have matched too. See section <a class="reference" href="#handling-small-variations-in-patterns">49.2.1</a> how to match with wildcards.</p>
<p>If the two parts of the loop are separated, one could use a main pattern and a <em>sub-pattern</em>. See section <a class="reference" href="#subpatterns">49.2.2</a> for more information on how to match sub-patterns.</p>
<h3 id="determine-conditions"><a href="#determine-conditions">49.1.3 Determine Conditions</a></h3>
<p>Next step is to determine what should happen every time the identified loop is entered. First, the necessary <em>pre-conditions</em> should be checked.</p>
<p>When all pre-conditions are fulfilled, the simulation can be fast-forwarded. To make it easier to update the state after fast-forwarding, we only fast-forward an even number of iteration, and let the processor simulate the last iteration. Then the pattern don't need to do any state updates by itself.</p>
<p>If the pattern gave no limit on how far a processor can be fast-forwarded, the pattern matcher will fast-forward it to the next event posted. The <code>advance()</code> function in the <code>step</code> interface is used to let the CPU actually fast-forward.</p>
<p>If the pattern need to do side-effects, it gets the actual number of steps forwarded as a return value from the <code>ffwd_time()</code> function. Here is an example that needs to update a loop register:</p>
<pre><code>static bool
pattern_triggered(conf_object_t *obj, pattern_t *handle, void *loop_data,
                  conf_object_t *cpu, physical_address_t paddr)
{
        test_pattern_t *tp = (test_pattern_t *)obj;
        struct per_loop_data *loop = loop_data;

        if (SIM_object_class(cpu) != loop-&gt;cached_class) {
                /* Either there is no cached interface pointer or it was cached
                   for another cpu class, so read them out again. */
                if (cache_interfaces(obj, loop, cpu) == 0)
                        return false;
        }

        int steps = tp-&gt;matcher.iface-&gt;ffwd_time(
                tp-&gt;matcher.obj,
                handle,
                cpu,
                LOOP_INSTR,
                0,
                0,
                COUNT_AS_IDLE);

        int regno = loop-&gt;cpuclass_regno;
        loop-&gt;reg_iface-&gt;write(cpu, regno,
                               loop-&gt;reg_iface-&gt;read(cpu, regno)
                               + steps / LOOP_INSTR);
        return true;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="test-correctness"><a href="#test-correctness">49.1.4 Test Correctness</a></h3>
<p>The quickest way to test that patterns are deterministic is to try running your machine with and without hypersim-patterns installed, and see if the state differs.</p>
<h3 id="measure-performance-improvements"><a href="#measure-performance-improvements">49.1.5 Measure Performance Improvements</a></h3>
<p>The impact of hypersimulating idle-patterns can be measured by the <code>system-perfmeter</code> tool. The <code>hypersim-status</code> command also have some information about how many steps that have been skipped.</p>
<p>If the performance did not improve as much as expected, it might be that either the pattern matched too often but the examine_pattern() method rejected it, or that the preconditions was not fulfilled often enough in the pattern_triggered() call. The percentage of successful calls can be listed with the <code>hypersim-status -v</code> command.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-topics"><a href="#advanced-topics">49.2 Advanced Topics</a></h2>
<h3 id="handling-small-variations-in-patterns"><a href="#handling-small-variations-in-patterns">49.2.1 Handling Small Variations in Patterns</a></h3>
<p>Often, a recompilation of the software can lead to small differences in the bit pattern of the idle loop. A pattern can be made to match many variants by placing <em>wildcards</em> in a pattern. Wildcards are done by replacing a digit in the pattern by a + sign, or, in the specialized pattern style, with zeros in the mask. One of our test patterns has wildcards on register values.</p>
<pre><code>static const char * const pattern[] = {
        "0x60000000",                    /* A. nop */
        "0b0011_10++_++++_++++ 0x0001",  /* B. addi rX,rY,1 */
        "0x4bfffff8",                    /* C. b A */
        NULL
};
</code></pre>
<p>If there are constraints on the wildcards, they need to be checked in the examine function. To continue the previous example, here is how it verifies that the same register is used as source and destination in the <code>addi</code> instruction.</p>
<pre><code>static void *
examine_pattern(conf_object_t *obj, pattern_t *handle, conf_object_t *cpu,
                logical_address_t vaddr, physical_address_t paddr)
{
        uint32 addi_insn = SIM_read_phys_memory(cpu, paddr + 4, 4);
        if (SIM_clear_exception() != SimExc_No_Exception)
                return NULL;

        int reg = (addi_insn &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 31;
        if (((addi_insn &gt;&gt; 21) &amp; 31) != reg) {
                /* addi rX,rY,1 where X != Y means no match */
                return NULL;
        }

        struct per_loop_data *loop = MM_ZALLOC(1, struct per_loop_data);
        loop-&gt;incremented_register = reg;
        return loop;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="subpatterns"><a href="#subpatterns">49.2.2 Subpatterns</a></h3>
<p>If the idle loop contains subroutine calls, the subroutine needs to be checked against a pattern too. This is done in the <em>examine</em> function. An example from the <code>arm-u-boot-hypersim-patterns</code> module is given below.</p>
<pre><code>/* This loop busy polls the counter, waiting for it to reach a certain value */
static const char * const main_pattern[] = {
        "0x++ 0x++ 0x++       0b100101++", // bl (get_ticks)
        "0x1f 0x00 0b000+++++ 0xeb",       // cmp x0, x++
        "0xc3 0xff 0xff       0x54",       // b.cc (wait)
        NULL
};

/* Function used by main loop - reads the counter */
static const char * const sub_pattern[] = {
        "0xdf       0x3f 0x03       0xd5", // isb sy
        "0x20       0xe0 0x3b       0xd5", // mrs x0, cntpct_el0

<h3 id="handling-time-dependent-loops"><a href="#handling-time-dependent-loops">49.2.3 Handling Time-Dependent Loops</a></h3>
<p>A loop which polls a cycle counter is called a time-dependent loop. An example that reads the timebase register on a PPC processor, whose pattern is given in section <a class="reference" href="#subpatterns">49.2.2</a>. Since steps and cycles does not correspond 1-to-1 in Simics, we need to take into account the conversion factor. In the case of timebase, the conversion is given by the equation:</p>
<p>steps = timebase cycles × cpu frequency × step-rate / timebase frequency</p>
<p>Below is an example from <code>[simics]/src/extensions/arm-u-boot-hypersim-patterns/wait-ticks.c</code>. In this example, the step-rate is not taken into account, so it only works for an 1:1 step-rate.</p>

<p>When Simics is started, the individual pattern modules announces their existence by calling the Python function <code>hypersim_patterns.add()</code>, from their <code>simics_start.py</code> files.</p>
<p>When a machine configuration is later loaded, its CPU architectures are checked against the registered patterns.</p>
<p>If there are patterns matching an architecture, an object of type <code>hypersim-pattern-matcher</code> is created and attached to the physical memory-space of that processor. This matcher object will, in turn, create one object for each registered pattern.</p>
<p>The reason why a pattern both need to register in Python code and later in C code is to avoid loading modules for hypersim patterns unrelated to the architecture being simulated.</p>
<p>The <code>hypersim-pattern-matcher</code> creates patterns with the SIM_create_object() call and sets the "matcher" attribute to point back to itself. That means there will be one pattern instance for each physical memory-space in the system.</p>
