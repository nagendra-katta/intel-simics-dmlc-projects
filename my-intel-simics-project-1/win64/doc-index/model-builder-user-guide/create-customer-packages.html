<p>Customer Packages are created with the <code>bin/project-packager[.bat]</code> as documented in the usage text available by running with the <code>--help</code> flag. The basic operation is to <code>cd</code> to the <code>[project]</code> directory and run the command. The packager will prompt for a package description, name, number, and files to include. By default all targets and modules in the <code>[project]</code> will be included. On subsequent runs the choices previously made will become the defaults allowing successive editing of package contents if simply including all is not quite specific enough. Interactivity can be disabled by using the <em>--batch</em> argument which simply chooses all the defaults. The resulting <code>.ispm</code> will be located in <code>[project]/packageinfo/[package name].ispm</code>.</p>
