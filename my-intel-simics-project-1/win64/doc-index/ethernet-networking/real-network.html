Connecting a simulator to a real network opens many new possibilities. For
example, it makes it easy to download files to the simulated machines using
FTP, to access the simulated machines remotely through telnet, or to test
software on simulated machines against real machines.
</p><p>
Simics provides three kinds of real-network connections. This chapter will go
through all of them in details, with numerous examples. Section
<a class="reference" href="real-network-examples.html">3.1</a> starts by explaining the preparatory steps
for all the examples presented afterwards. Section
<a class="reference" href="real-network-connections.html">3.2</a> goes through all three kinds of
real-network connections, how they are set up and what they provide.
</p><p>
Some real-network connections require specific configuration on the host
system: these are covered in section <a class="reference" href="real-network-access.html">3.3</a>.
Section <a class="reference" href="real-network-interface.html">3.4</a> describes how to select the
correct host interface when running on a host with multiple Ethernet
interfaces.
</p><p>
Finally, section <a class="reference" href="real-network-performance.html">3.5</a> describes how to tune
real network connections to improve their performance, and section
<a class="reference" href="real-network-troubleshooting.html">3.6</a> contains a troubleshooting guide to
help diagnose problems.

<b>Note:</b>
Connecting a simulated network to a real network requires some knowledge
of network administration issues.</div>
