 Postpones execution of a script branch the specified break condition is true.
<p>
The break condition is specified as (read, write, or execute) on <i>address</i> for an object implementing the <tt>breakpoint</tt> interface. For physical addresses, this is typically a <tt>memory-space</tt> object, and for virtual addresses it is a <tt>context</tt> object.
</p><p>
Accesses intersecting the given range will trigger the break. By default the break will only trigger for instruction execution, but any subset of read, write, and execute accesses can be set to trigger using combinations of <tt>-r</tt>, <tt>-w</tt>, and <tt>-x</tt>.
</p><p>
<i>length</i> is the interval length in bytes (default is 1).
</p><p>
By default, the break condition is set on memory connected to the current frontend processor (see <code>pselect</code>). Default is to break on virtual address accesses (in the current context). To break on physical accesses, prefix the <i>address</i> with <tt>p:</tt>.
</p><p>
Use <i>prefix</i> to define the break condition on instructions with this prefix. For example, a prefix "add" will wait for an instruction that begins with "add". The text to compare the prefix with for an instruction is the one which the instruction is disassembled to. The comparison is case insensitive.
</p><p>
Use <i>substr</i> to wait for instructions with a certain syntax substring. For example, specifying a substring "r31" will wait for an instruction containing the substring "r31". The match is case insensitive.
</p><p>
Use <i>pattern</i> to wait for an instruction with a certain bit-pattern. First the <i>mask</i> will be applied to the instruction and then the result will be compared with the <i>pattern</i>. For example, a pattern "0x0100" and mask "0x0101" will wait for an instruction whose first byte has the lowest bit set and the second not.
</p><p>
Note that pattern and mask are supplied as strings with string byte order (low address first).
</p><p>
The command returns the initiator object of the memory transaction that resulted in the breakpoint.
</p><p>
If <i>timeout</i> is a positive number, the command will run for at most that many seconds of virtual time.
</p><p>
If <i>timeout-rt</i> is a positive number, the command will run for at most that many seconds of real time.
</p><p>
A time-out will be signaled by throwing a CLI exception, which can be captured using try/except in order to take specific action, or to let it pass unhandled.
