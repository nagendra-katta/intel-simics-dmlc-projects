 Enable hypersimulation.
<p>
Hypersimulation is the ability of the simulator to detect that a loop is only waiting for something to happen without actually doing anything, and that it is possible to skip forward in time immediately to the next interesting event (such as a timer interrupt).
</p><p>
Single-instruction loops (an instruction that jumps to itself) can often be detected by the processor model itself; this detection is always enabled.
</p><p>
Some simple loops can be detected during JIT compilation of the target software. This feature is only supported for some processor architectures. This detection is normally enabled, but can be turned off with the <tt>-no-auto</tt> flag.
</p><p>
More complicated loops can be detected using the hypersim-pattern-matcher module which uses hand-written specifications, hypersim classes, that describe the structure of the loops and how to simulate them correctly. Hypersim classes are specific to processor architectures and target software. By enabling hypersimulation, all hypersim classes are connected to matching processors in the configuration. To disable the pattern-matcher the <tt>-no-pattern-matching</tt> flag can be used.
</p><p>
Enable verbose mode with the flag <tt>-v</tt>. The command returns the names of the used hypersim-pattern-matcher objects.
