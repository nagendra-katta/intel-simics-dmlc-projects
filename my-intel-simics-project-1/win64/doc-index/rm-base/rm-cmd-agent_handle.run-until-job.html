</h2>
 Run the simulation until commands that are already posted on this <tt>agent_handle</tt> object have completed, and then stop the simulation. If the simulation is not running, this command will start it.
<p>
A command posted on an agent handle is given an integer ID which is unique per handle. With the <i>job-id</i> argument, specify a command that must have completed before the simulation is stopped. Without argument, this command will run the simulation until all commands have completed, those which were posted on this handle before this command.
</p><p>
If the <tt>-capture</tt> flag was specified together with the <i>job-id</i> argument, then any captured output from that job will be returned from this command or printed. Note that the captured output will be discarded afterwards.
</p><p>
Queued commands are run sequentially, meaning that the next command will start once the previous has completed. Thus, all commands that were posted before the specified argument are guaranteed to have completed successfully.
</p><p>
If an error occurs, the execution is stopped and <i>all</i> pending commands that were posted on this handle are discarded, and the error is reported.
</p><p>
<b>Notice:</b> This command is not intended for script-branches.
