<h1 id="managing-deprecated-language-features"><a href="#managing-deprecated-language-features">C Managing deprecated language features</a></h1>
<p>As the DML language evolves, we sometimes need to change the language in
incompatible ways, which requires DML users to migrate their code. This
appendix describes the mechanisms we provide to make this migration process
smooth for users with large DML code bases.</p>
<p>In DML, deprecations can come in many forms. Deprecations in the form of
removed or renamed symbols in libraries are rather easy to manage, since they
give clear compile errors that often are straightforward to fix. A slightly
harder type of deprecation is when some language construct or API function
adjusts its semantics; this can make the model behave differently without
signalling error messages. A third kind of deprecation is when DML changes how
compiled models appear in Simics, typically to adjust changes in the Simics
API. Such changes add another dimension because they typically affect the
end-users of the DML models, rather than the authors of the models. Thus, as an
author of a model you may need to synchronize your migration of such features
with your end-users, to ease their transition to a new major version.</p>
<h2 id="deprecation-mechanisms"><a href="#deprecation-mechanisms">C.1 Deprecation mechanisms</a></h2>
<p>The simplest deprecation mechanism is Simics API versions: Each deprecated DML
feature is associated with a Simics API version, and each Simics version
supports a number of such API versions. Features reach end-of-life when moving
to a new Simics major version, the features belonging to a previous Simics API
version are dropped. Since Simics is currently the primary distribution channel
for DML, this deprecation scheme is used for DML features as well.</p>
<p>This scheme allows users with a large code base to smoothly migrate from one
Simics major version, N, to the next, N+1:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, while still using version N, make sure all Simics modules are updated
to use API version N. Modules can be migrated one by one.</li>
<li>Second, update the Simics version to N+1. This should normally have no
effect on DML, but may come with other challenges.</li>
<li>Third, update modules to API N+1, one by one. Simics version N+1 will always
offers full support for API N, so there is no rush to update, but changing
the API version early makes sure deprecated features are not introduced in
new code.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the API version, DML offers some compiler flags for selectively
disabling deprecated features that are normally part of the used API. This has
some uses, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>During migration to a new API version, disabling one deprecated feature at a
time can allow a smoother, more gradual, migration.</li>
<li>If a legacy feature is still fully supported in the latest API version, then
it cannot be disabled by selecting an API version, so selectively disabling
it is the only way to turn it off. There are reasons to do this, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>Disabling a feature before it is deprecated guarantees that it is not
relied upon in new code, which eases later migration.</li>
<li>Avoiding a feature that has a newer replacement makes the code base
cleaner and more consistent.</li>
<li>Some legacy features can also bloat models, by exposing features in a
redundant manner. This can also have a negative impact on performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="controlling-deprecation-on-the-dml-command-line"><a href="#controlling-deprecation-on-the-dml-command-line">C.2 Controlling deprecation on the DML command-line</a></h2>
<p>DMLC provides a command-line flag <code>--api-version</code> to specify the API version to
be used for a model. When building with the standard Simics build system, this
is controlled by the <code>SIMICS_API_VERSION</code> variable in <code>make</code>, or the
<code>SIMICS_API</code>/<code>MODULE_SIMICS_API</code> variable in <code>CMake</code>.</p>
<p>DMLC also provides the <code>--no-compat=<em>tag</em></code> flag, which disables the
feature represented by <em><code>tag</code></em>. The available tags are listed in the next
section. The tag also controls the name of a global boolean parameter that the
DML program may use to check whether the feature is available. The parameter's
name is the tag name preceded by <code>_compat_</code>.</p>

<h3 id="features-available-up-to-and-including-simics-api-6"><a href="#features-available-up-to-and-including-simics-api-6">C.3.1 Features available up to and including --simics-api=6</a></h3>
<p>These features correspond to functionality removed when compiling using
Simics API 7 or newer. With older Simics API versions, these
features can be disabled individually by passing <tt>--no-compat=<em>TAG</em></tt>
to the <code>dmlc</code> compiler.</p>
<dl>
  <dt id="dt:dml12_goto"><a href="#dt:dml12_goto">dml12_goto</a></dt>
  <dd>
<p>The <code>goto</code> statement is deprecated; this compatibility feature
preserves it. Most <code>goto</code> based control structures can be reworked by
changing the <code>goto</code> into a <code>throw</code>, and its label into a <code>catch</code>
block; since this is sometimes nontrivial, it can be useful to disable
the <code>goto</code> statement separately.</p>
</dd>
  <dt id="dt:dml12_inline"><a href="#dt:dml12_inline">dml12_inline</a></dt>
  <dd>
<p>When using <code>inline</code> to inline a method in a DML 1.2 device,
constant arguments passed in typed parameters are inlined as
constants when this feature is enabled. This can improve
compilation time in some cases, but has some unintuitive semantic
implications.</p>
</dd>
  <dt id="dt:dml12_int"><a href="#dt:dml12_int">dml12_int</a></dt>
  <dd>
<p>This compatibility feature affects many semantic details of
integer arithmetic. When this feature is enabled, DMLC translates
most integer operations directly into C, without compensating for
DML-specifics, like the support for odd-sized
<tt>uint<i>NN</i></tt> types; this can sometimes have unexpected
consequences. The most immediate effect of disabling this feature
is that DMLC will report errors on statements like <code>assert 0;</code> and
<code>while (1) { ... }</code>, which need to change into <code>assert false;</code> and
<code>while (true) { ... }</code>, respectively. Other effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Integers of non-standard sizes are represented as a native C
type, e.g. <code>uint5</code> is represented as <code>uint8</code>, allowing it to
store numbers too large to fit in 5 bits. With modern DML
semantics, arithmetic is done on 64-bit integers and bits are
truncated if casting or storing in a smaller type.</p>
<p>Old code sometimes relies on this feature by comparing variables
of type <code>int1</code> to the value <code>1</code>. In DML 1.4, the only values of
type <code>int1</code> are <code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>, so such code should be rewritten
to use the <code>uint1</code> type. It can be a good idea to grep for
<code>[^a-z_]int1[^0-9]</code> and review if <code>uint1</code> is a better choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some operations have undefined behaviour in C, which is
inherited by traditional DML 1.2. In modern DML this is
well-defined, e.g., an unconditional critical error on negative
shift or division by zero, and truncation on too large shift
operands or signed shift overflow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparison operators <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code> inherit C
semantics in traditional DML, whereas in modern DML they are
compared as integers. This sometimes makes a difference when
comparing signed and unsigned numbers; in particular, <code>-1 !=  0xffffffffffffffff</code> consistently in modern DML, whereas with
compatibility semantics, they are consiered different only if
both are constant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>dml12_int</code> feature only applies to DML 1.2 files; if a DML
1.4 file is imported from a DML 1.2 file, then modern DML
semantics is still used for operations in that file.</p>
</dd>
  <dt id="dt:dml12_misc"><a href="#dt:dml12_misc">dml12_misc</a></dt>
  <dd>
<p>This compatibility feature preserves a number of minor language quirks
that were originally in DML 1.2, but were cleaned up in
DML 1.4. When this feature is enabled, DML 1.2 will permit the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>sizeof(typename)</code> (see <code>WSIZEOFTYPE</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the <code>typeof</code> operator on an expression that isn't an lvalue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>select</code> statements over <code>vect</code> types</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passing a string literal in a (non-<code>const</code>) <code>char *</code> method argument</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the character <code>-</code> in the <code>c_name</code> parameter of <code>interface</code> objects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the <code>c_name</code> parameter to override interface type in
<code>implement</code> objects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>loggroup</code> identifiers are accessible under the same name in
generated C code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applying the <code>&amp;</code> operator on something that isn't an lvalue
(typically gives broken C code)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>extern</code> statements that do not specify a type (<code>extern foo;</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anonymous banks (<code>bank { ... }</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unused templates may instantiate non-existing templates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same symbol may be used both for a top-level object (<code>$</code>
scope) and a top-level symbol (non-<code>$</code> scope, e.g. <code>extern</code>,
<code>constant</code> or <code>loggroup</code>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
  <dt id="dt:io_memory"><a href="#dt:io_memory">io_memory</a></dt>
  <dd>
<p>The <code>transaction</code> interface was introduced in 6, and will
eventually replace the <code>io_memory</code> interface. When this feature is
enabled, the top-level parameter <code>use_io_memory</code> defaults to
<code>true</code>, causing <code>bank</code> objects to implement <code>io_memory</code> instead of
<code>transaction</code> by default.</p>
</dd>
  <dt id="dt:shared_logs_on_device"><a href="#dt:shared_logs_on_device">shared_logs_on_device</a></dt>
  <dd>
<p>This compatibility feature changes the semantics of log statements
inside shared methods so that they always log on the device object, instead
of the nearest enclosing configuration object like with non-shared methods.
This behaviour was a bug present since the very introduction of shared
methods, which has lead to plenty of script code having become reliant
on it, especially in regards to how banks log. This feature preserves the
bugged behaviour.</p>
</dd>
  <dt id="dt:suppress_wlogmixup"><a href="#dt:suppress_wlogmixup">suppress_WLOGMIXUP</a></dt>
  <dd>
<p>This compatibility feature makes it so the warning <code>WLOGMIXUP</code> is
suppressed by default. <code>WLOGMIXUP</code> warns about usages of a common faulty
pattern which results in broken log statements — for more
information, see the documentation of <code>WLOGMIXUP</code> in the
<a href="messages.html">Messages</a> section.</p>
<p><code>WLOGMIXUP</code> is suppressed by default below Simics API version 7 in order
to avoid overwhelming users with warnings, as the faulty pattern that
<code>WLOGMIXUP</code> reports is very prevalent within existing code. Addressing
applications of the faulty pattern should be done before or as part of
migration to Simics API version 7.</p>
<p>Passing <code>--no-compat=suppress_WLOGMIXUP</code> to DMLC has almost the same effect
as passing <code>--warn=WLOGMIXUP</code>; either will cause DMLC to report the warning
even when the Simics API version in use is below 7. The only difference
between these two options is that if <code>--no-compat=suppress_WLOGMIXUP</code> is
used (and <code>--warn=WLOGMIXUP</code> is not), then <code>WLOGMIXUP</code> may still be
explicitly suppressed via <code>--no-warn=WLOGMIXUP</code>. In contrast,
<code>--warn=WLOGMIXUP</code> doesn't allow for <code>WLOGMIXUP</code> to be suppressed at
all.</p>

the <code>*</code> is omitted in the pointer type. When disabling this feature,
any declarations on this form:</p>
<pre><code>extern typedef struct {
    void m(conf_object_t *);
} my_interface_t;

<p>need to be changed to the standard C form:</p>

  <dt id="dt:legacy_attributes"><a href="#dt:legacy_attributes">legacy_attributes</a></dt>

<p>This compatibility feature makes DMLC register all attributes using the
legacy <code>SIM_register_typed_attribute</code> API function instead of the modern
<code>SIM_register_attribute</code> family of API functions.</p>
<p>Disabling this feature will make the dictionary attribute type ("D" in type
strings) to become unsupported, and any usage of it rejected by Simics.
Thus, when migrating away from this feature, any attribute of the model
that leverages dictionary values should be changed to leverage a different
representation. In general, any dictionary can instead be represented by a
list of two-element lists, e.g. <code>[[<em>X</em>,<em>Y</em>]*]</code>,
where <em>X</em> describes the type of keys, and <em>Y</em> describes the type of
values.</p>

  <dt id="dt:lenient_typechecking"><a href="#dt:lenient_typechecking">lenient_typechecking</a></dt>
  <dd>
<p>This compatibility feature makes DMLC's type checking very inexact and
lenient in multiple respects when compared to GCC's type checking of the
generated C.
This discrepency mostly affects method overrides or uses of <code>extern</code>:d C
macros, because in those scenarios DMLC can become wholly responsible for
proper type checking.</p>
<p>While migrating away from this feature, the most common type errors that
its disablement introduces are due to discrepencies between pointer
types. In particular, implicitly discarding <code>const</code>-qualification of a
pointer's base type will never be tolerated, and <code>void</code> pointers are only
considered equivalent with any other pointer type in the same contexts as
C.</p>
<p>Novel type errors from uses of <code>extern</code>:d macros can often be resolved by
changing the signature of the <code>extern</code> declaration to more accurately
reflect the macro's effective type.</p>

<p>The log level that may be specified for logs of kind "warning", "error"
or "critical" typically must be 1, and any subsequent log level must
typically be 5. This compatibility feature makes it so either log level may
be any integer between 1 and 4 for these log kinds. The primary log level
is always treated as 1, and any other value than 1 for the subsequent log
level will be treated as 5 (that is, the log will only happen once)</p>

<p>This compatibility feature makes it so that methods defined under
object arrays don't implicitly assert that the indices used to reference
the object array when calling the method are in bounds.</p>
<p>Migrating away from this compatibility feature should be a priority. If
its disablement makes the simulation crash due to an assertion failing,
then that <strong>definitely signifies a bug in your model; a bug that would
very likely result in memory corruption if the assertion were not to
be made.</strong></p>

<p>When this compatibility feature is enabled, the version
specification statement (<code>dml 1.4;</code>) statement at the start of

<p>In Simics 5, configuration attributes for <code>connect</code>,

<code><em>bankname</em>_<em>attrname</em></code>. Such proxy
attributes are only created When this feature is enabled.
Proxy attributes are not created for all banks and ports, in the

<p>Version 5 and earlier of Simics relied on interface ports (as
registered by the <code>SIM_register_port_interface</code> API function) for
exposing the interfaces of ports and banks. In newer versions of
Simics, interfaces are instead exposed on separate configuration
objects.  When this feature is enabled, old-style interface ports
are created as proxies to the interfaces on the respective port
objects. Such proxies are not created for all banks and ports;
e.g., banks inside groups were not allowed in Simics 5, so such
banks do not need proxies for backward compatibility.</p>
